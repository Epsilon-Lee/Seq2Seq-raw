thank you .
stephen watt .
björn sundin .
thank you .
we go through initiationsrituale .
it &apos;s interesting .
very expensive real estate .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m a novelist .
is that sensible ?
that &apos;s hard .
not entmutigt .
this is felix .
the sun goes up on the sun .
the orange traktor .
yes , hello .
fantastic , right ?
that &apos;s wrong .
long , yes .
yeah , milliseconds .
the only chance .
nullemissionen , yes ?
it doesn &apos;t happen instead .
that &apos;s efficient .
all the umweltdiskussion .
not toxic inside .
but it goes .
yeah , sort of .
music as a language .
lento , slowly .
i wonder .
that &apos;s the singing .
they need time .
a autistischer student .
that &apos;s quick .
here it is .
this is vorbildlich .
not very sustainable .
they schlemmen . &quot;
that was fascinating .
an enormous challenge .
we need energiewunder .
thank you . thank you .
bg : thank you .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s awful .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
it works like this .
very different term .
we know this .
dk : 60,000 .
and he says ...
a few less .
we were .
it has sensors .
i swear .
does it sound good ?
after a week .
you can go .
i was shocked .
thank you .
that was incredible .
not a hospital .
thank you .
... not yet .
this is frightening .
it &apos;s generisch .
yeah . okay .
a whole lot .
jk : both .
i can help .
i was amazed .
ban is blank .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m tom .
thank you .
i created one .
are all that ?
we lose them .
oh my god !
ohhhhh , wowwww !
there was remixe .
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
we were arm .
where ?
centers were built .
my gut again .
that &apos;s not ...
bewerte again .
we raise off .
i vertrete children .
or bombs .
it would be unerträglich .
it would be gewissenlos .
we love innovation .
we love entertainment .
oh my god .
schlafmangel is ubiquitous .
there are online-kriminelle .
they sell zertifikate .
they durchbohrten each other .
thank you very much .
these days are over .
what do you want to do ?
they actually hurt .
everyone needs a goldfischglas .
this was the result .
i think they &apos;re abscheulich .
can we change it ?
just make your job .
this is the speicherbecken .
this was about christmas .
this is the last .
good work ! yes !
so let &apos;s see .
yeah , good afternoon .
thank you very much for listening .
that &apos;s it .
they had no media media .
yeah , that &apos;s it .
what are media today ?
they have similar principles .
why does this happen ?
does anybody see a particular thing ?
a dalmatiner , right .
i see the dalmatiner .
this is our present .
what does fünfundzwanzig milliseconds take ?
give pee a chance .
this is completely traumatic .
i want to tell you .
no tree is kohlenstoffneutral .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we can do it differently .
and it has to come back .
wonderful , one ?
but the wrong things .
what do they say then ?
every waste is nährstoff .
so not like detox .
we can do that .
does it make you curious ?
the work of interpreten .
you ask questions .
that &apos;s all interested in me .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
you see it immediately .
i can say everything .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
yeah , good afternoon .
the names today are projektträger .
we were 20 people .
that &apos;s all right .
that &apos;s the system .
what a fish .
i wanted to support them .
let &apos;s call him .
that &apos;s me .
what did they do ?
they fluteten the channels .
the farm is incredible .
there &apos;s no food .
can i be honest ?
and i was an artist .
it was really incredibly profound .
who is it going to make ?
next : nuklearenergie .
that &apos;s great .
that &apos;s a wish .
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
who is the most successful ?
what was the result ?
there are also weltrekorde .
and i understand that .
people were playing nuts .
we talk about it .
the data came in .
but you know what ?
not very often .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
pretty good , right ?
dark urine . dark .
there was no cantaloupe-melonen .
why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because you know what ?
yeah , i know .
how do we know that ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
thank you , danny kahneman .
so they can do that .
it may sound nasty .
players don &apos;t sit around .
glückselige productivity . fantastic !
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
it comes from creativity .
there &apos;s no normal .
oh , so the one .
that &apos;s very good .
a couple more .
what about longevity ?
maybe 10 times .
it opens the door .
why not live longer ?
these are going to be unwiderstehlich .
so it &apos;s true .
they &apos;re all important .
be a mentor .
who are these related ?
play is not silly .
so where do we go ?
ooh , thank you .
thank you very much .
first extension , second .
italy wins . yeah .
here &apos;s the video .
his name is tempt .
i was standing to him .
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
they did it .
that sounds scared .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
almost identical structure .
the power plant can explode .
i have a question .
that would have been okay .
that &apos;s very risky .
this is the kurzfassung .
überlegene technology .
it keeps you fresh .
hmmm , my brand ?
my name is amit .
i see this pluszeichen .
polite , all the applaudiert .
first , beschränken .
but you know what ?
how interested they are .
let me summarize .
so how does this work ?
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i lived in parallelwelten .
i don &apos;t know .
is it at even photography ?
what creates the illusion ?
oh . a moment .
okay . thank you .
so they meet al .
and that &apos;s important .
they use their hands .
there are two options .
i &apos;m going in here .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
silence is ohrenbetäubend .
i find this fascinating .
i find this fascinating .
we &apos;re constantly chasing each other .
i thought about it .
i don &apos;t think so .
that was great .
here &apos;s an example .
let &apos;s talk about wasser-kriege .
what need these people need ?
hey , why not ?
it doesn &apos;t work .
1,000 , very good .
i learned all the stuff .
but i kept working .
asked the nurse scotland .
so she was back .
they gave her their blutdruckerhöher .
her family came together .
and she did .
and i kept working .
actually , he made fish .
it was a zackenbarsch .
what &apos;s happening here ?
this is what happens today .
we have three hauptgruppen .
these people deserve money .
this is alfred gonzalez .
diginotar is a zertifizierungsstelle .
privacy has to be given .
the rocks are farbcodiert .
i &apos;ll stop that .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
the living support tracks .
now , what does that mean ?
so what does that mean ?
156 nations are sending our fernsehkanal .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
the official dogma of what ?
these are all einnehmende questions .
here &apos;s another example .
third , eskalation of expectations .
do you want to have jeans with holes ?
but i felt bad .
we only signed up .
why should we do that ?
seriously -- the demise of geweiht !
and i always had that .
why not think about that ?
this is a jährlicher tauwasserfluss .
these rivers are taking rapidly .
the wassermengen have expanding .
leave that for us .
they really loved it .
this is a interactive trickfilmanwendung .
it &apos;s his own story .
so what &apos;s now about hacking ?
this is what you see down there .
how do we actually work people ?
that sounds largely unusual .
they didn &apos;t have books .
let &apos;s make a little zwischenbilanz .
from the vogt-zeitalter to the maschinenzeitalter .
we &apos;re not producing ourselves .
that &apos;s not going to do it .
pattern recognition should work .
now you see the dalmatiner .
it &apos;s an exciting phenomenon .
you have to understand that .
this is called osit-modell .
and it depends on phosphorus .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
the phosphor-problem is much more critical .
it makes leukemia to children .
but that &apos;s not a protection .
don &apos;t you , yes ?
so we are too many .
but where are we useful ?
we can return our nutrients .
in china , it was different .
the byproduct is clean water .
but we need that .
or take a lippenstift .
there &apos;s any footprint there .
we say in germany of sustainability .
so there are two cycles .
all of it is kompostierbar of it .
that must be the altersunterschied .
he was over 60 .
his personal impressionen of seerosen .
that &apos;s what most people here know .
this is like the sprechenlernen .
because you can train that .
were you ever jealous ?
it &apos;s against justice .
it will always be more similar .
it &apos;s interested in the feuermachen .
there he went .
because i can say everything .
these things are logical .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is a naturding .
this is what &apos;s imagined .
it &apos;s engaging with failure .
there are four thousand people living there .
it &apos;s not just technological .
what should all be done ?
and here &apos;s the representation .
and then they set up .
i only loved two .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
2.5 to one , great .
let &apos;s call him .
it kind of verkuppelt us .
the chef had verkocht him .
he showed up the algae .
but what do you eat ?
how is the futterverwertung ? &quot;
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
i &apos;ll never cook with it .
i don &apos;t like this question .
they want to feed the world ?
now i see greg lemond .
so you saw something magic .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
what lessons have we learned ?
it &apos;s been konstant .
first , we have the population .
today , 6,8 billion people live .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
and also , these vents were unterbrechungen .
and there &apos;s the lagerungsproblem .
that really solves the treibstoffproblem .
how should our testimony look ?
this has the biggest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to spread the message .
this is just a versicherungsmethode .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
it was a huge success .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and then realize it .
now i tried something interesting .
now , what do you think happened ?
there &apos;s a schritt-für-schritt-anleitung there .
and why is that ?
diphterie , röteln , kinderlähmung ...
the result of this was devastating .
because anybody here has measles ?
so paul is a terrorist .
the data shows this all the time .
i agree with you completely .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i push my sleeve back .
but the key thing is ...
yeah , here it is .
there &apos;s a lot of glücks-coaching .
but it didn &apos;t .
he had the experience .
there &apos;s an old study .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
they have so much uncertainty .
so the correlation is low .
that &apos;s not true of emotion .
and there are plenty of collaborators .
so the first aufrechte primate primate .
and finally , epic importance .
they create a epic story .
edward castronova is a volkswissenschaftler .
that sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;ve been playing for warcraft .
the game is from 2007 .
i &apos;ll come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
i think rather not .
how about fitness ?
is this all einbildung ?
or is it possible ?
some of them came and left .
sexual reproduction is in the picture .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
it cost 2,7 billion dollars .
these changes are coming .
who does not want to get healthier kids ?
play is not just kinderspiele .
and this is called androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so what happened for years ?
and women are argumentierten that .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
is it going to be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
good afternoon , everyone together .
here &apos;s the city .
you see the timeline up .
they saw the great clue .
and then everyone went down .
it really enjoyed him .
you can have this cloud .
here you see roberto dancing .
here you see it .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
no insurance can be querstellen .
turn the engines down .
i had a good life .
it feels great .
you see the water coming .
but it was very sad .
and then something funny happened .
and that worked very well .
and it got better .
but it gets worse .
is that your opinion ?
i &apos;m a redundante person .
that was more to the objection .
imagine the camera .
what else is that risky ?
we &apos;re a smaller token .
that &apos;s a great question .
and this is a millionen-konzern .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . well , good .
so the spikes are very good .
what other brands do they do ?
that &apos;s a great question .
and it took 18 months .
i grew up in india .
so you go to googleartproject.com. .
only further . a lot of fun .
these are all metadata .
you see something fun here .
apparently it was very popular .
they come from artists .
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be ergänzen .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
and again , he showed him javier .
the two calls me .
it &apos;s just a thousand square kilometers .
one place is south korea .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
here &apos;s her marmeladen gait .
third technology : kategorisierung .
here are two different types of pollen .
okay , a few more .
what am i looking at ?
this is what the graphics looked like .
and then it became international .
something versteifte in me .
loans and sponsors were sought to look .
so i followed my gut gut .
after just one journey there .
is it about the light ?
here &apos;s another example .
but it requires a lot of planning .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe even in our cell phones .
i work in the solartechnologie-branche .
it &apos;s rapidly spreading .
so scott gets this anfruf .
they combined these two people .
have you seen these guys ?
something very strange happened here .
that &apos;s what it looks like .
it &apos;s about .
it has billions of them .
maybe taking some mutations .
but they do the job .
so it creates a rückkopplung .
that really made me sad .
but what do we do with this ?
and this opens up a map .
these are the apsaras .
my cousins was around everywhere .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
my brother plays me .
i was devastated .
i &apos;ll assure you something .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
the only country in the world .
i vertrete people in todeszellen .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
we love technology and creativity .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply .
we want to eliminate masseninhaftierungen . &quot;
sometimes i press too much .
so i went to the court .
once the judge saw me .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
crisis . disaster .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
and many people forget this .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
we &apos;re thinking about energieknappheit today .
and there &apos;s good news .
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
and so it was .
i felt really good .
actually , i did two mistakes .
my second mistake was worse .
the notfallpersonal was all the strands .
and then it happened again .
he always showed up here .
and fortunately , he died .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
and it &apos;s the crux .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
my name is brian ghonim .
it &apos;s about veränderbare normwerte .
it was my first sonnenbrand .
it &apos;s five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it &apos;s still fish .
this is a dead turtle .
once again , we started one alive .
she wasn &apos;t ertrunken .
but it won &apos;t be documented .
you always lose rare animals .
what do you do with zertifikaten ?
the firmenhauptquartier is right here .
they tap their internet connection .
privacy is not the debate .
so littlebits open source .
they &apos;re the heimatländer of somebody .
our magazines are being read by millions .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
a has these benefits and risks .
it &apos;s all easy to have .
the answer is yes .
second , what economists call oppertunitätskosten .
they could have done it better .
so let me remind you .
economists call this a pareto-verbesserungs application .
we &apos;ve got unique elements here .
sunlight and carbon dioxide is a method .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
it &apos;s caused by huge amounts of heavy control systems .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
okay , that &apos;s really the courage .
like that , you know .
so the question is : how ?
what is this thing ?
go and quäle leonard cohen .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
the dauereis is with red .
this is a completely unhaltbares entwicklungsmuster .
this picture reminded me of something .
this is the sun growing up .
now i add a bass .
it was quite a schickes project project .
or they didn &apos;t have any fotolitografie .
no , no , no .
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
this is a game for outside .
for example , this perception in context .
does anybody know what that is ?
so it &apos;s n .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
then i can transmit the whole .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
we depend on two countries .
and that &apos;s what we take .
people over the urine .
there &apos;s no überbevölkerungsproblem on trees .
and we are too many .
imagine mozart efficient .
that &apos;s the minimum .
not all of them should be kompostierbar .
for example , the sneaker , right ?
technical cycles are the same .
if it &apos;s the waste right now .
i started an institute .
so , basically a translation of translation .
the beweggründe , it &apos;s writing .
how and what does he feel ?
have a nice example of this .
that &apos;s a teil part .
because for me , it means memory .
now , the tools have been fortentwickelt .
it was just not invented .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
and how did that feel like this ?
i &apos;m going to shoot something through my head .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
picasso says wait .
my wife told me it .
here you have this little mechanism .
we can &apos;t just do that .
and then he can just davonlaufen .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i stumbled him in particular .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
it automatically goes to the right idea .
again , you have it again .
and they have a problem .
thank you for your attention .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
cannot be a problem .
it turns out smart-grid .
so , smart-grid , riesenthema everywhere .
and of course , that &apos;s incredibly adaptive .
this is going to happen in april next april .
for nathaniel , music means seelische health .
i hope you forgive me .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
i said , &quot; hühnchen-pellets ? &quot;
i &apos;m struck by this fish .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and environmental was a catastrophe .
they literally umgelegt the lever .
schlemmen ? i was totally confused .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
he shook his head , no .
this is a ökologisches network .
a billion people are starving today .
the creativity had to somehow come out .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
they live with help .
it was really changed the dynamic .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
in fact , the fortschrittsgesellschaft is based on energiefortschritten .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
if you burn charcoal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
so that &apos;s a tough way of doing it .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
this is going to change a key shift .
it should not suffer other things .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
they &apos;re not investing in time time .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
my grandparents preferred this number on 70.
we &apos;ve got them bezwungen . pop .
so that &apos;s the good news .
the same thing , only bigger .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
and that kind of durcheinander me ...
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
and he actually says that .
nobody ever said that before .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
we lean food out of food .
and why ? gentechnisch changed food .
it &apos;s about like a potato .
because we don &apos;t want to have genes ?
the dosage also plays a role .
and the shape plays a role .
everybody &apos;s talking today about happiness .
what &apos;s a story of ?
they didn &apos;t change the story .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
it was almost beyond imagination .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
but it &apos;s definitely not a optimalsituation .
so this crazy story could vote .
so , we can .
i &apos;ll give you the post .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
widrigkeiten are just to our lives .
honestly -- who is normal ?
i really wanted to be normal .
the students are divided up .
do you want to be more confident and more confident ?
what would you like most ?
how many people would choose to vote ?
we have a kind of equilibrium .
now , how could this happen ?
and this was 19 years ago .
well , i was the next .
the hauptmann winkte to me .
but the game is a formwandler game .
both are überlebensfähig , both fire .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tiger .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s going to be total .
thursday : confidence is key .
they become a computer in free .
this morning , before the game .
the game starts -- silence .
the data was not available before .
the whole building was made of water .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
you can play with different kinds of play .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
and this video is in real time .
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
we won a couple of awards .
this is a painting of a circle .
she did it for three years .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
so we start with a windows-dropper .
that &apos;s a fool , right ?
completely in a particular destination .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
this is just the arbeitstitel .
we need to think about what brands .
that would have been no problem at all .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
a whole piece of cool food .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
these things have a positivere effect .
how would you describe your brand ?
i really like nice clothes .
lawyer : i &apos;m a anwaltsmarke .
tell me about this world .
what else do you go through ?
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
the film hasn &apos;t been ausgeliefert .
you go around and participate .
they want to orient in the museum ?
now this is one of the images .
i &apos;m going to show you this .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say that .
you can be feeling and intuitively .
basically they do the same thing .
this is a picture of the object .
and we did that .
so we measured his movement .
we &apos;ve driven into an area .
this picture is from this place .
they even bring funding with one another .
think about your own choices .
now we saw the opposite effect .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
here &apos;s a description of the street .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
this is a highly unnützes kategorisierungsschema .
who do you actually want to inform ?
we need to slow up complexity .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
well , let &apos;s do it .
he had uploaded a lot of naturvideos .
what &apos;s happened on this day ?
that &apos;s it , very simple .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
who could have all this voraussehen ?
the story is not over yet .
i never met him personally .
no , never had a chance .
her mother just moved her own .
the defeat would have been too simple .
who would ever wish ?
i thought everybody could .
but it &apos;s got an unexpected twist .
and yet , a realistic plane .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
it &apos;s from a quarry quarry .
how can we help you ? &quot;
and every morning i &apos;ll leave it .
and we &apos;ve created a ipad-app .
it makes you pay attention .
this is a modest little app .
and that &apos;s nothing at all .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
in boston , it &apos;s not just a call-center .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
good night , cute beutelratte . &quot;
so the occupythesec-bewegung has done it .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
but that &apos;s not that quick .
we don &apos;t go on that .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
and these are the neural structures .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
all these generations need few milliseconds .
it &apos;s verworrene and strange programs .
so , gewissermassen überflügelt the technology .
we &apos;re in the middle of this übergangpunkt .
now we do this with airplanes .
i was scared of technology .
the storytelling always took more sense .
i talked a lot about magic .
the kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
we use the energy of the sun .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
she was a daughter &apos;s daughter .
i probably shouldn &apos;t .
this is perhaps going to be public .
my uncle died at alkoholinduzierten diseases .
many of my clients are very young .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
i talk a lot about these questions .
do you want dazukommen and listen ? &quot;
what are you trying to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
you should also want to .
then he mir me into the ear .
well , i walked in the gerichtssaal .
in fact , we have redefined poverty .
so the rate itself is speeding up .
&quot; a pale blue cover . &quot;
because we live on a wasserplaneten life .
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-milliarden-marke .
we have the passion of a diy-innovatoren .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropen .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
it &apos;s the durchschnittsleistung of the schlägers .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
but , you know what ?
i was a marilyn obsessiver student .
she was back and dying .
but slowly , it turns out .
i started feeling better .
alone , ashamed and no support .
but there are two problems in this .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
all of this is embedded with errors .
and it starts with a doctor .
they share their experiences with others .
i &apos;m the definierte doctor .
people were still happy .
and that &apos;s what nobody seems to do .
zertifizierungsbehörde hacken and gefälschte zertifikate .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument makes no sense .
lego made it possible for all possible .
and it was an incredible experience .
and of course , we all share the same anpassungsnotwendigkeiten .
a language is expression of the human mind .
54 percent of deaths happened by durchbohrungen .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused .
you can &apos;t do anything like this .
but these are all streets in the u.s.
let &apos;s get a little push now .
many of them are covered by faces so well .
this is my supermarket . no big .
and there are several reasons for this .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
everyone in my manhattener neighborhood is gone .
well , this cartoon does some statements .
the truth is more like this .
we started this 15 years ago .
it turns out it &apos;s extremely difficult .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
this is the hauptmechanismus of evolution here .
this is underneath geneva .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
we konditionierten them , they reparierten .
like algae -- and other things .
if you don &apos;t , today &apos;s other people .
his whole arbeitsprozess has changed after that .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
fantastic ! this machine is quite noisy .
it &apos;s about a neuversorgung of america .
i start with some simple examples .
so for him , they were just bauklötze .
we wanted to develop a lernmittel for sprachlerner .
so , that was my primary motivation .
and you can continue to continue on the list .
more than these other kinds of networks .
and that &apos;s really in the beginning .
now , what &apos;s actually archaische models ?
i &apos;d like to show you this .
this is what happens to maschinenzeitalter .
on the book and on the picture .
we have an abstract language .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
maybe again , a look at it .
so from modern to the computergesellschaft .
every society is defined by a primärmedium .
at the beginning , the stammesgesellschaft through the language .
that the theme of ecology is a global one .
in the third time , you &apos;ve forgotten .
you can see from the back to the front .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
it just has to process it as a present .
how can i make a difference with this ?
and less usable or benutzungsfreundlich is it .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
i &apos;m trying to do this by a beispiels .
now , everyone &apos;s got a cake .
and the curiosity is not learning .
schütz the environment , make less waste .
the environment , verbrauche less energy .
that &apos;s just a little bit less devastation .
and it &apos;s kind of packaging or content .
a baby needs about six diapers .
so with that , men can &apos;t be pigs .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
that means we need to zurückkriegen phosphorus .
but it &apos;s really effective , yes ?
that &apos;s not what resource efficiency is ; it &apos;s efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
we think about north .
so not saving , avoid , avoid .
you can show , i was there .
that &apos;s what had just been presented .
it &apos;s a direct rücknamesystem .
if you come to that , yes ?
all around the world , these craftsmen are all around .
we can reinvent everything else again .
so every concert is another concert .
and he said , &quot; he &apos;s like that ?
he &apos;s lived only for years .
you can &apos;t talk about interpretation .
and it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
tell that what they feel .
it &apos;s not just a nice geräuschtapete .
and this sounds quite different from before .
so the first step to an interpretation .
the seven mountains and so on .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
because now you can apply a dreisatz .
they &apos;re still familiar from school school .
in this case , three sentences come in .
and here they are .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
say , there &apos;s no vorhersager .
there was the kernforschungsanlage leopoldshafen .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
it &apos;s a box of a box .
we also have very detailed data .
how far do you get there ?
and then we said , okay .
simple , it &apos;s going to be coming .
so i just started playing .
music is medicine . music is changing .
and so he entflieht his quälenden .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
they have the flow of water vice versa .
and here he comes up with a rare gleitaar .
now , he mentioned the mineralbedürfnisse of phytoplankton .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
a fischaufzucht , but also a vogelreservat .
do they do that for the kids ? &quot;
it &apos;s this beißende , verkohlte taste taste .
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
you can dive in a particular year .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar curse .
so i &apos;m listening to that .
i was totally wissenschaftsbegeistert , you know .
i could draw . i could paint .
i didn &apos;t get frustrated .
so , they &apos;re sort of motivated my two passions .
so , that really blew me .
we went back to the titanic of the titanic .
so that was a very strange experience .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
for energy to me , this was one .
so here are some natural fireflies .
it should have the two elements .
there &apos;s a lot to come together .
we need to use more ads .
anyway , we need a solution .
bg : a energiedurchbruch is most important .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
but there &apos;s another reason .
because they have special skills of prozessbegleitung .
what do you think happened to these design-studenten ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
and that can make a big difference .
and everyone in this room has to go in .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
not even the truth will free them .
we have measles in this country now .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
we &apos;re running into the poor of the placebo-industrie .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
that has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s quite , morality , patentkram .
so , look what happens .
and the goal is very simple .
i hold the knife in my hand .
what ? that really freak me out .
i normally would take the needle .
everybody would like to make people happier .
he had 20 minutes herrlicher music .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
there seems to be an disagreement .
and we get an absolutely flat line .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
no , i mean it really seriously .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
if you haven &apos;t heard it , you haven &apos;t heard .
so we &apos;ve got 1.5 billion players .
five million people use it every month .
in front of these fantastic spielecontrollern , there were schafsknöchel .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
they divided the kingdom in two halves .
here &apos;s the aktualisierte version of this eintrags .
we can give ourselves something to ourselves .
maybe we can see widrigkeiten as a change .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
i remember my first fire .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
ladies and gentlemen , their pets .
intersexualität comes in many different forms .
so we have this awful vereinfachende idea .
they had a concept of blue blood .
we see the same thing with the behindertenrechtsbewegung .
how do you evaluate people because of their charaktereigenschaften ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
do we really want to go to this direction ?
conditions of this kind of exist in us .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
just be , just who you are .
wednesday : your inner child hug .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
let &apos;s start with a sense of view .
a four and a half years ago in italy .
it was a italy called the fußball-weltmeisterschaft .
and it doesn &apos;t matter in italy .
second halbzeit . end of the normal guys .
zidane , in a moment of kopfstoß .
we called it the digital water .
the roof was also covered with water .
you can do that all the time .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
but the truth is far away .
this is the average size of a grönland-eisbergs .
and that was the outbreak of it .
he can only use his eyes .
thank you so much , that was incredible .
this is something like our kampfschrei .
it &apos;s all coming from our own pockets .
and i had to go out of town .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
he says , &quot; bereitmachen for effect . &quot;
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
okay , you really want to know ?
i went to jail -- difficult .
the goal of this whole film is transparency .
so , meaning , not so optimistic .
in terms of words , what would you say ?
man 3 : i &apos;m the schmusetyp .
man 5 : brand alkoholsüchtiger schreiberling
you brought up your pictures , yes ?
i like things that are different .
the first is a classic apple .
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are they achtsam and mondän like 007 ?
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
emc präsentiert : welcome transparency
thank you , but the best part is coming .
you can get very easily in and rauszoomen .
but then they really want to go deep in .
another lieblingsbild of mine , sternennacht .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
it &apos;s just too accurate to zeitpunkten voices .
the rest of the time are delokalisiert .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
also , städtedesigner and -bauer are very interested .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
and i &apos;d like to read you the one .
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
oh my god . oh my god .
in fact , bear didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
even cats look at this video .
nobody needs to give your ideas green light .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broke through the story .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
no apple ever tasted again .
my mother was suffering from the boat .
i was not familiar with the etikette .
there had to be another puzzlestück .
for a year , we had no cent .
we worked until late night .
her father died shortly after her birth .
&quot; they don &apos;t get rid of them . &quot;
secondly , together , they should have the same beleuchtungsart photos .
the bank is from another place .
we have all navigationssysteme in our cars .
and sure , we can find fastfood-ketten .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
oh , my time is over ?
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
and that worked . for scott .
scott went from human to human .
beutelratte ? yes . alive ? yap .
so every tröpfchen was a little different .
the zellengemeinschaften began to abstrahieren information .
it could take place within a period of time .
speichere , ab the rest .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
it can know where we are .
i learned this from my grandmother .
there are a couple of hochinteressante approaches .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of work .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
i think our identity is threatened .
we want to do something about the death penalty company .
we want to lower the number of death deaths .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all do .
he came to me and umarmte me .
i had written these crazy things .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
it was the fehlgeleitete kreuzzug against drugs .
but maybe this is not the case .
child mortality has been reduced to a tenth .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and we &apos;re increasing our expectations constantly .
now look at this curve .
notice two things on this curve .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
the king of siam , however , got aluminium-besteck .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silikate .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
so this has been a problem problem .
do you know how to call a 400ter ?
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
and there &apos;s feedback to my oberarzt .
maybe i did it with good reason .
they barely breathe and was blue angelaufen .
they closed them up to the beatmungsmaschine .
she had not suffered a behandelbaren gehirnschaden .
this is the kind of lehrreicher shame .
but i asked these questions .
why went to medicine ?
in one thing , i thought he had nierensteine .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
i thought i could integrate myself .
if you put it , this is what happens .
the difference is the loss of loss .
there can be a sequence of changes .
that &apos;s now largely our goal .
so , you don &apos;t lose a very common animal .
this is the simulation bay .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
but western governments are helping themselves .
but today we are far beyond .
we &apos;ve also got littlebits .
the ethnosphäre is the great legacy of humanity .
now this level of intuition is very important .
it &apos;s our new village , and it &apos;s called nunavut .
every big picture is the beginning of a abschnitts .
or other models , or even technical specs .
übereinandergelagert on the top of nasa &apos;s picture .
there are the ones that are much more powerful .
i &apos;m very grateful for the desk here .
yes . it doesn &apos;t matter anything else .
the official glaubenssatz of all western industrialized societies .
i just want to briefly say something about salatdressing .
so that &apos;s what the supermarket is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
we did not stabilize identity ; we invent them .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
i could park in front of my house . &quot;
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
they &apos;re worried about that .
it &apos;s increasing the paralysis and lower happiness .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
they laughed more than she does here .
so , this looks like a basketball-playoff .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
it has a molekulargewicht of over 300 million .
it will provide a challenge for nine .
we take images of these mini-urknalle in detectors .
it just wasn &apos;t , you know , you know ?
oh , jesus , what a thought !
everybody knew their genius was paralyzed .
it would be on the land on them .
when your job is dancing , it &apos;s tanze .
and when it wasn &apos;t , it &apos;s your dance .
it grows in winter and schrumpft in summer .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland .
but we start to see a change .
you saw it in the news .
frosty , the kohlenmann will be clean every day .
this is one , part of her .
saueber coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean kohletechnologie .
versorge america is new . find more .
we have to go far , which is fast .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
and they &apos;re also feeling their motions and whistles .
this is our youngest beta-tester on the bottom right .
now he gets a tractor into the scene .
now i &apos;m going to do something more drums .
i can change the sequence while it &apos;s going .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
as i said , it &apos;s just started .
and that &apos;s what they do .
now , if you think a little bit further .
but i &apos;m going to talk to you about that again .
and then the verblassenden influences of the vorindustriellen cultures .
what &apos;s left us is the storytelling .
i want to just explain a little bit about this .
and the two letzteren are also here today .
a forschungssemester to the natural user user interface .
to say , what is information ?
and further , now you see him .
that &apos;s rather the norm .
and there &apos;s a central point .
so , of course , we can look at the müllproblem .
this is going to be balanced in china a second .
because that &apos;s because of it , right ?
have you ever seen a klimaneutralen tree ?
we can support them , be good .
so this is what &apos;s called the verbrechensraten .
we can support them , be good .
and we see that it &apos;s done .
but you can &apos;t replace phosphorus .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
i say , herzliches beileid , yes ?
but with the right design , please .
in two hours , she builds up everywhere .
do you remember the tangent ?
it &apos;s about a beneficial poop print .
and in my jugendlichkeit , i said , expectation .
the x-malige interpretation of a piece is comparable to this .
especially if he died .
a phrase with his own breath .
because the music is the extension of our body .
because artists have a verhältnis relationship to the lie .
because we cannot live without these lebenslüge .
a particularly nice story , i mean .
so , it &apos;s going to come from the outside to people .
the logic doesn &apos;t say anything about reality .
we can continue these things in different examples .
gleichgroße forces with gegensätzlichem vorzeigenzeichen lösen each other .
and in berlin , there was a crazy ingenieurkollektiv .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
these were the very first calculations about six years ago .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we have 30 gigawatts today in germany .
i was playing the first sentence of beethoven violinkonzert .
it &apos;s hard to überbewerten the destruction .
he has a futterverwertung of 15 to one .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your bäuche , pink .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles back .
i mentioned to the miguel and er .
so let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
you can dive with a decade in a decade .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
as a child , i used to wear comic books and so forth .
i was obsessed with studying the deep sea .
these blöden films don &apos;t make us any money .
there &apos;s a connection that comes together .
so what can we do from all this ?
it &apos;s also very important for them .
isn &apos;t half the or a quarter ? &quot;
it &apos;s great that this number is rising .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
and what do you do with the waste ?
the last three of the five have been summarized .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
there are a lot of great books to this topic .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
you can predict that . why is it ?
they lead the process , they understand it .
i thought , let &apos;s put the pokereinsatz right away .
there was never a time like this .
my ur-großeltern died all of them as they were 60 .
my parents are the 80 on the fersen .
anyone know what that is ?
that &apos;s skandalös and we should be ashamed .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t do so much .
and they &apos;re not only going to die in measles .
we had no kinderlähmung in this country yesterday .
have you all taken their vitamins tomorrow ?
this is great . i love the placebo-industrie .
and i have all kinds of kleinen here .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
they have them . they always have them .
and some of them worked , and some of them didn &apos;t work .
we get rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we don &apos;t want firms to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want firms to have seeds .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
that &apos;s also a role point of play .
well , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
people in the nebenräumen are now coming in .
well , the erinnernde self is a storyteller .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
thank you . i have a question for you .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
this is a portrait of the photographer phil toledano .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
this guy is just a kurz victory .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
players are masters of social nets .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
what do you think happens next ?
antonyme : healthy , strong , fix . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
it was summer and i had shorts .
and then , of course , it made click .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130.000 years .
in front of him is a beautiful spärlich showgirl showgirl .
i &apos;ve tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to reconnect the health of a disease .
it &apos;s the only test of survival and success .
we call these robots exoskelette .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
as i said , amanda carries our elegs .
he &apos;s a steel of hope from my consciousness .
the dog ! i was amazed .
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressivität .
but bonobos are showing us the other side of the coin .
play is the kitt that beieinanderhält us .
look at what she does .
in other words , play is our anpassungsjoker .
so two pairs , every single one baby .
we come back to these people later .
so lots of testosterone , but no reaction to that .
they are in the back of our body .
he had an extreme form of an innate nebennierenrindenhyperblasie .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
they moved into a naturalistischen concept .
but how do you do that in practice ?
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
so this is the reason for this project .
well , we introduced the mayor of belloch .
here &apos;s how the building works .
i want to show you something first here .
it &apos;s also a echtzeit-3d-scan and a bewegungsaufnahme .
so that they can sense the whole movement .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important .
ordinary people are not available these devices . &quot;
make it possible -- all of you here .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a geräuschloses airplane .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bordpersonal .
i never want to move anything in life .
you probably knew the schuhgröße of the maschinenbedieners .
looks like an old-fashioned assemblersprache .
so that made sense , it ties together .
so again , that &apos;s really good together .
it &apos;s natanz and it &apos;s just natanz .
it &apos;s actually a lot more dangerous and more dangerous .
so at this point , we need digital sicherheitssysteme .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
i &apos;ve been working in a kohlebergwerk -- dangerous .
no , that was what i thought .
it &apos;s unvorhersagbar -- like this strange landstraße .
i want to help you to calm .
you should tell me something about my brand .
all right , what is the brand brand ?
i sell schmusetiere throughout the country , globally .
tell me a little bit about this part .
we should put the bear in the cage .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
well , who is ready for this journey .
because it doesn &apos;t feel like we &apos;re real money .
in 2010 , it had been seen 23 million times .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzlestückchen .
but so many people got over the years .
life has been changed for centuries .
&quot; not &quot; turned out to be a unwahr .
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
when i say reality , i &apos;m foto-realität .
and here &apos;s a piece of very good planned .
she &apos;s got a button up .
i put my job in 95 lbs .
next week , it &apos;s coming to the market .
we have herumgefragt , and nobody knew .
it may be , until it geladen .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
there &apos;s a lot of people left the government today .
this is the call-center for service and information .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the beutelratten .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
and we use this word with such contempt .
you could just show the slide .
all the ones that were so , they started aufzuteilen .
the dna model of dna was an interesting step .
the next step was now within these communities .
so we have the zeitskalen again .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
now we do this with bohrern and machines .
they kept us from being inspired by this .
it can know how we hold it .
this is a really extraordinary honor to me .
she had the last word in every familienstreit .
my mother was the youngest of 10 children .
i said , &quot; listen , grandma . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
my grandfather was in prison during the prohibition .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
wealth , not verschulden , affects the outcome .
yet , we seem to be very pleased with this .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
an amazing fehlerquote . one of nine innocent .
and yet there &apos;s this mental abkopplung .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
it was always so inspirational .
we want to argue and combat discrimination and discrimination .
i &apos;ve learned a couple of very simple things .
right , bryan , the judge has zauberkräfte .
polizeibeamte came in and stellvertretende staatsanwälte and office workers .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
56 percent of all vergewaltigungsfälle are not coming to court .
8 : tsunamiwarnung . sprecher .
different speakers : drogenkrieg mass extinctions . tornado .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
it slowed down for neither of our big problems .
thirty years ago , this would have failed .
and we saw this in mobile phones .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
and this is very important in the medizinforschung .
and this game was played by universitätsprofessoren and so on .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
well , really good , maybe a all-star .
and that was not a difficult diagnostic diagnosis .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the hilfsbedürftige doctor .
and i went back to work .
the three words loud : do you remember ?
i was shocked , and i was shocked .
and that was what i felt .
it was a lot , and i &apos;m in a hurry .
it turns out he was a streptokokken-infektion .
he had potentially a lebensgefährliche disease called epiglottitis .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
what you need is a new medical culture .
it &apos;s supporting others from their mistakes .
i &apos;m a person . i do mistakes .
yet , we &apos;re still on the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
they still describe them as pristine as pristine .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
they become less rare because we &apos;re catching them .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
you can &apos;t put them around the ground .
they just listen and start talking .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and the problem is not the technology .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
if you want to create it , it &apos;s between the images .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
but niederlassen is not always a bad thing .
their problem is they have too little .
you don &apos;t know anything in this room . &quot;
our steps on earth were exponentially in denial .
you may have heard that we have waterzeichen eingebaut .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of automation .
this is not a elektronenmikroskopaufnahme , it &apos;s a reguläre mikroskopaufnahme .
this is footage about a period of six seconds .
we &apos;re now focusing on resolution of the fourth generation .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
and they had to remove what we did .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
at the end of march , the lhc will be funktionsfähig again .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
i may have another 40 arbeitsjahre in me .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
this is one of the most profound korrekturen of a creative life .
and „ olé ! “ for you in spite of this .
but the volume is far bigger than ever before .
this is 20 feet meereshöhe , like greenland .
there is a political dispute in our country .
one of the commercials of the kohleindustrie around christmas was this .
frosty der is a vergnügter , happy fellows .
the most powerful bergarbeiter is the head of massey coal .
new investment , to create good paying jobs .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversation with you all .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself-bio dot org , d.i.y.bio .
and then we &apos;ve been working on a code-of-conduct .
they virtualisieren the reality and no computers .
and in that mind , memory was happening .
it &apos;s been the most significant tool that we have known for the last stories .
and they did this with something called lead-landkarten .
where the language was rang by untergeordnetem .
we &apos;ve been moving in the so-called vogt-zeitalter .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
anyway , they do that .
and we &apos;d like to look at this now .
we understood that the weather is global .
so how do we work when we get there ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
now , everyone &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
and sechzehn milliseconds , also an exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s what &apos;s just about the wiege to be wiege .
in the soil , over 60 percent of the land is stored .
it &apos;s kind of like all of you in the vorwindelphase .
there is opec a bunch of waisenknaben .
because you know , this is a lustvoller process .
it &apos;s a form of revierverhalten , right ?
but today we just talk about the biological systems .
no , we stuck what &apos;s inside .
it &apos;s all in that it &apos;s useful .
hey , puma , does you really seriously ?
because now they &apos;ve changed twice the vorstandsvorsitzenden .
so , let me just help you a little bit .
interpreten are the geschriebenen notes in klingende music .
in fact , the notes are very vague and ungenau .
you accumulate information about the piece in the sekundärliteratur .
to keep zwiesprache , right with the composers .
but maybe you can also even umstimmen them .
can you play it in blue now ?
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
he &apos;s just considering it and not himself .
so , we can &apos;t get these things together .
there &apos;s only the second best thing , the fire department .
this is the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re accurate .
i can say , the kanzlerin is a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you about what &apos;s true .
so when klaus says , there &apos;s no soul .
however , it wasn &apos;t that happened in the years .
they have a renewables today from 15 percent .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go back to a slide .
and then it looks like this .
our goal was to just say , okay .
that &apos;s what nobody has done in the world .
and then inspired a whole bunch of simulations .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and that &apos;s the n .
and in time , they can react to others .
then we have to reduce our must-run capacity on the net .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
let &apos;s call him miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
this is a fischaufzucht in the südwestlichen corner .
they did that by turning the country up .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
now i &apos;m going to choose the government .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
i grew up with a portion portion of science fiction .
we &apos;ll show it in the eröffnungssequenz of the film .
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
in the course of this voyage , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i think first of all , it &apos;s curiosity .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
so , a climate change will be horrible for you .
well , the energiepreis is over time .
this has to go down to zero .
the triebe the u.s. for hundreds of years .
many are talking about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
the hauptproblem here is the equivalent of aids .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
now , they understood the end of the sequence .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
we do as if we had a machine here .
but you know what you don &apos;t quite have right ?
they were just like people in this room .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
this is a idiotische debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
you know , there was no mandarinen in paradise .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
you know , science is not a company .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
there &apos;s someone in the back who doesn &apos;t have a childhood .
i &apos;m really sorry . do it crazy ?
so let me show you the closeness .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive case .
well , the erlebende itself lives forever .
and they ask , what happens to these moments ?
that &apos;s not how it works at all for the erinnernde self .
the erlebende self has no voice in that election .
we think about our future as a vorausgesehene memories .
which is the emotions that can be measured ?
there are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant .
well , your own self is not going to be happier .
the more money you deserve , the more you get happier .
this is a problem that many players have .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
we &apos;re developing ourselves , so creatures .
you expect a extra billion player in the next decade .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
what we want is to create the future .
so i say , let &apos;s start the weltverändernden .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open your door ?
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
again , what potential would we want to take a tag ?
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
raise your hands . let me see .
how many would choose for a good memory ?
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
so they go , save the shoes .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees , our next living relatives .
we &apos;re learning trust and the rules of the game .
but are we going to do the best of our spieltrieb ?
imagine that for a moment .
we produce androgen and we &apos;re talking on androgene .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
i &apos;m a jessi and this is my suitcase .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a rollenden iceberg .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
tempt was one of the leading graffitikünstler of the &apos; 80s .
so they communicate -- this is how their fingers walk along .
so i talked a few months later at a conference .
so they pull around and they make kunstinstallationen like this .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
there &apos;s now all this rummel before the big unveiling .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
today , i want to tell you about circles and offenbarungen .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingbroke .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
it was something we knew .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t matter .
here &apos;s a clip from this angriffs- code .
we &apos;re talking here -- about 15,000 lines code .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
the idea is to cheat a digital model .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generisch .
you could also use ordinary wurm- technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
so the driving force is the cyber- superpower .
i filmed in kriegsgebieten -- difficult and dangerous .
you know how many people are watching tedtalks ?
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is going to be very , very likely .
no wanting to do something with the movie .
actually no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
and then we offer one of these great düfte .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
these are the people that are shaping my worldview .
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
there was a lot of crazy things going on there .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
it &apos;s not in other countries .
you can look around in all these museums here .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
i love this guy ; his expression is unbezahlbar .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best part is , in a second .
but what if you want to see the pinselstriche ?
you go in . you can really go in .
this is sternennacht , probably never seen this before .
and that was an experience for me .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical self didn &apos;t enjoy it .
in the summer of 2009 , honduras was suffering with a severe verfassungskrise .
he asked octavio to be on his stabschef .
in the airport alone , there &apos;s a 100 percent surface of it .
the faces of the audience were very serious and carefully .
a typical wal-mart today gives you 100,000 products today .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
because the images made it feel real for you .
three things : tastemaker , teilnahmecommunities and the unexpected .
it was almost 200 million times this year .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s put together .
my grandmother never left me his life .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the besteck .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
is it about the details , or the colors ?
so i think the basics are very simple .
and let me show you a simple example .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
we know one more where all the gas stations are .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
he &apos;s like , &quot; beutelratte &quot; in the official database .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real regierungsarbeit is happening .
we need to rely on the engines of the government .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
these little öltröpfchen were in the sense of primitivste .
and try again with another generation .
and from me , a character is going to be in the book .
fireflies in a glass found i always found quite exciting .
and it &apos;s the way through the rest of the book .
it also shows itself in other places of the book .
at a point , the screen adds with petals .
i thought that this was a game game .
we just alberten around like this .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in haftanstalten and in prison .
i think , in my opinion , the world is fundamentally changing our world .
in many areas , people had to have scared .
so these women were meeting and they were just talking .
and i went over and just listened to it .
wr want to help people who have been innocent convicted .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
and then i ask myself : how could that happen ?
and i have to say , there was power .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a break .
bryan stevenson : well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
there &apos;s a chance to do something here .
what would you tell someone who believes ?
so these dramatic numbers are coming in the prisoners .
recession . stillstand . doomsday . egypt . syria .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
so the amygdala is our frühwarnsystem , our gefahrendetektor .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleons soldiers received silber-besteck , napoleon themselves .
it &apos;s new nanotechnologien on the way , nano-materialien .
this is technologieunterstützte innovation that exists today .
what are you going to consume ? what will you want ?
i studied my wife and she was in atemnot .
i hired them and made me the treatment .
i remember it as though it was yesterday .
both cases of nagten me , fraßen me .
some of my favorites happened in the last five years .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
you know , he &apos;s been 1835 here .
he described one of them as a very , very common .
now he &apos;s standing on the red list .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a huge loss .
the question is , why do people accept this ?
this is wladimir tsastsin from tartu in estonia .
somebody was hacked , and he was gründlich the system .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of diginotar .
it &apos;s called &quot; automatically stein rock . &quot;
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
and we want to make this material for all available .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
and the crucial shoots for this is extinction .
but the waorani didn &apos;t just kill außenstehende with the spear .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all controlling mineralvorkommen .
this is a whole book , an example of nichtbild-daten .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
and we &apos;re so often inventing as much as we want .
and the world we were living in this way .
do you want the buttons or reißverschluss ? stone or acid ?
it &apos;s also my big lifelong love and fascination .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
in fact , it can feel quite extraordinary sometimes .
she said it was like a donnernder train of air .
he ran all the way and did something completely new .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t get into human anymore .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other kohlefabriken .
this is in our entire country &apos;s country of zweitgrösste americas .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
if we zoom in , we can do a little bit of zurückschütten .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is actually not supposed to be a joke , but .
now , what kind of projects do we do now ?
i think that &apos;s like six dollars or something .
so , i think it &apos;s a very gelungener .
and this is the kernanliegen of the biohackern .
this is a pretty remarkable number of people around the world .
how many doors did the house do in which they live ?
the only thing that they had was her head .
and life lived in the küstenregion of british columbia .
that means you &apos;re talking about sound sounds and rhythm .
we &apos;ve been used to that things happen to happen linear .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
i apologize that i must abkürzen .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there .
this is how it happened to be on the village .
and what does it look like in there ?
there &apos;s more to my glasses .
i don &apos;t know who of you this picture .
this is the time where you fall in love .
so , how does a human being relate to certain things .
we could only glide as amorphe mollusken through the weltmeere .
if we actually don &apos;t have phosphorus , and we &apos;re actually giving .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
that means the ants weigh much more than us .
there are still six and a half billion trees in the amazonasgebiet .
because the frankfurter plant could get the phosphorus back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
we &apos;ve now worked on three years now .
and the oil will replace us by other energy .
no , that &apos;s exactly the right thing , right ?
you can get them off where they go and stand .
in the countries where people come to money .
i can &apos;t play like in 20 years today .
because the notes are the only connection to him directly .
loud and b , and b and b , etc .
this is the hammerköpfe in the piano of my fingers .
the dauernde days of music today is not förderlich .
i wonder , how fachlich was this diagnosis ?
whether the music is too sweet or too sweet .
so that was the first beginning of a musical expression .
and , at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to do the n little car ?
and then i immediately think of that , that &apos;s unfair .
spanish painter pablo picasso once a woman .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
do you know , and then you experience the sentence .
we actually know that something else is the case .
the soul is something intellectual , say , about leibniz .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
because , in fact , this person isn &apos;t really interested in proving .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you ?
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
and then we started to negotiate with the insulanern .
have investors negotiate , i &apos;ve looked for new gesellschafter .
we can also zweihundert kilowatt kilowatt on the web .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
this first one , that was more like a passionate cause .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
this futterverwertung of 2.5 to one , he said .
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? what do you feed ? &quot;
i had eaten him first in a restaurant in südspanien .
a journalistin journalist had spoken for a long time .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
i was not there at all a long time ago .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely selbsterneuernd .
so the pinker the belly , the better the system . &quot;
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
because when the water blows up , it versinkt in the atlantic .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too wide .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
so i &apos;m going to step back and erweitere the perspective .
you make something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the popular wikipediaseiten .
well , that &apos;s really good to do this .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t do you yourself .
probably one of those numbers must get close to zero .
the second factor is the services that we use .
i left the tides , geothermal , fusion and biofuels .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
there are some innovations in the nuklearbereich ; modular , liquid .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
a very specific wish that we can invent this technology .
where is the biggest interest , what really makes it happen ?
this is an alternative of one thing that was made .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
specialized skills and prozessfähigkeiten and their combination lead to success .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and i took a while to find out .
these were umsichtige people , educated people , decent people .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths through measles , 20 per hour .
he befreite us from one of the worst geißeln of humanity .
i don &apos;t need to say , but vaccines are essential .
they verdunkeln their urine . they almost never do .
so we run away , and where do we go ?
there were no weihnachtsbäume . we did all this .
they need it , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
maniok is something that a half billion people eat .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
anyway . that &apos;s what i want everybody to do .
i &apos;ll do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife like that way .
probably many of you here in the room know this trick .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo-effekt ?
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
this is my flesh , and i can do that .
the first of these fall is a widerstreben , complexities .
what had it ruined was the memories of the experience .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
but one of them is worse than the other .
it has moments of erlebens , one after another .
most of you are completely ignored by the erinnernden self .
the biggest difference between them is to deal with time .
i mean , how much do we mean from our memories ?
so i want you to think about a thought of thought .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
we currently spend three billion hours a week with online-spielen .
ok , imagine how extreme selbstmotivierung .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
and that &apos;s an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and these were kind of the first of people developed spielgeräte .
so , i think we &apos;re going to play a game today .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
this is a fascinating adventure that you go to .
this supercomputer called &quot; global aussterbungs- sensibilisierungs-system , &quot; of course .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a synonym-wörterbuch at that time .
they bring them to open doors .
and then it was also after three months .
how would it be to live for good health ?
is it for others , or does it matter ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
our gut is a wonderful gastfreundlichen environment for these bacteria .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to develop .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
so , just imagine two other little changes .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known about the primates .
in most of my activities , i have two hüte .
and that &apos;s why the testes on the fötalen stage testosterone .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
in our account , we went to all kinds of unbequemen areas .
we see that in all sorts of different realms of human life .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a bildpunkt , as flying bildpunkt .
this is what they would call in ingenieurteams , echtzeit-kontrollsystem .
here are the results we &apos;ve just got .
but that &apos;s a lot of unnützer transporte and more complicated things .
did anybody see the movie and taucherglocke ?
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i said , &quot; please in the air . &quot;
and i feiere , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense of me .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i want to tell you how we found that .
these zentrifugen in iran are divided in 15 levels .
and guess what we found in the angriffscode ?
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human being .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to ask .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
i don &apos;t know how empfänglich people will be .
how much money will it require to realize ?
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
i really like your kind , sergey brin . now .
so how exactly are we going to be cut in the movie ?
are you ? you see a little nervous .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
what about me ? what about the druchschittstypen ?
this is my brand , verzerrten industry .
what &apos;s next is what you want to talk about .
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
a little more about you , not you are .
and i think there &apos;s almost one contradiction .
a achtsame , verspielte brand . how is your brand ?
and what was it for you ? what it was successful ?
this is just online -- no press , no television .
it &apos;s not even online . no streaming .
after all , we should be welcome to fear .
click , you know , you &apos;re in this museum .
that &apos;s really cool , it &apos;s called the collections .
this is the gesandten , in the nationalgallerie .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
look , let me give you an analogy .
quantum mechanics says that unbewegliche objects are just feeling like this .
we found that really strange .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what really fantastic .
there &apos;s more , it &apos;s going to be deeper .
now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
all the parties , all the fraktionen of society , supported this .
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
it was a store that was draeger .
this business , it was almost like a vergnügungspark .
they always worry that they &apos;re losing up .
well , let me show you a little bit more about this .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
autofarben , außenfarbe of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
and this video was actually already sent in january .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endlosschleife .
and all this leads to a big question .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was completely ausgeschlossen that it could fail .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i met the decision to go to the u.s.
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s really just about making different realities .
but they can combine something special like this .
for example , the fish had been taken on a anglerausflug .
this is my wlan-waage . a very simple thing .
and over 10,000 people have been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
but it does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regierungstechnologie .
so he got the citizens to test them .
and it has been verbreitet , of course , organic , of course .
but what happens to &quot; citizens connect &quot; is different .
turned the mülltonne up . went home .
that &apos;s great . this is the digital hit .
so let &apos;s call it a lot of money .
so , if you could turn the lights back .
in fact , we are such a mehrzellige community .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
so nowadays , evolution can happen in time of microseconds .
so in other words , i first define what i want .
so , find programs which are the most likely to emerge .
finally , i get some programs that can be sortieren .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of this yet .
the child in me is really excited about these possibilities .
you can say things here that have influence worldwide .
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about power of identity .
it was also the origin of many of the differences in our family .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also disabled .
i remember it when it was yesterday .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justizsystem .
the united states has the highest inhaftierungsrate in the world today .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about the death penalty .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to do injustice against injustice .
we want to eliminate lebenslängliche haftstrafen without bedingte for children .
even who kills someone , it &apos;s not just a murderer .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . it &apos;s a story to end .
i had a 14jährigen , poor black boys as a client .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
we have evolved from the rhetoric of punishment .
and i think our current current is not helping anybody .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
i love this : &quot; watson bezwingt human adversaries . &quot;
it &apos;s about understanding the language of language .
it &apos;s about knappen goods of goods .
so let &apos;s take this analogy to the future .
16 terawatt energy prasseln all the 88 to the earth &apos;s surface .
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
there &apos;s a program that may have already known some .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and the whole time i &apos;ve collected more and more knowledge .
and when i got her zuhörte , she made her keuchende sound .

in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of umgänglichen errors .

in the future , most crimes will play online .
there are cases of diginotar , which is where we are .

littlebits are electronic modules that have a specific function .
but wait , this is really my lieblings-projekt .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysische worldview .
christianity , islam , buddhism , judaismus or whatever .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a e-buch .
there &apos;s a series of photographs here -- here they are .
they get a model that comes from all over the globe .
a consequence of it was the phone never broke .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
why do they advertise us when we can &apos;t buy ?
and the world we live in now is like this .

this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
in clinical depression , the industrial world exploded in the last generation .
a chromosome is just a piece of chemical material , by the way .
this is the publication that we did recently .
there are enzymes that are called the restriktionsenzyme that actually digest dna .

on the last ted conference , i had an introduction to the lhc .
these wires lead 13-tausend ampere when the machine runs on hochleistung .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s going to change .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your work .
i would rather be doing this work that i love .
this search led me to the old greece and the old rome .
the greeks called these divine diener-geister of creativity „ demons .
if your work floppte -- not entirely your fault , right ?
it &apos;s like asking someone to eat the sun .
but even i have this thing in my inbox , sometimes i have this thing .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not able to do it .
but instead of getting out of panic , he just stopped .
i started thinking , i should just einstampfen the project .
i &apos;ll keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here .
in the andes , this glacier is the trinkwasserquelle for this town .

we think it &apos;s clean -- and also smells well .
versorge america is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
so when i put them side-by-side , that &apos;s what you &apos;re interested in .
most people know that most people know that from the softwarebereich .
and then i took a sahnespender , and that &apos;s connected .
so i know some of the things that don &apos;t eingetragen .
and that &apos;s just the biohacker , the individual people .
and the third part , which is actually explaining by itself .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god to virtualisieren .
and other examples , other examples , are the ambienten , smart systems .
these are rooms that can respond to a human being .
so of course , of course , extremely entgegenkommt , and it &apos;s a computer game .
but i &apos;m just going to do it a little bit more .
and , of course , what design is like is influence on perception .
gestaltgesetz of the continuity , gestaltgesetz of the continuity and so on .
and that &apos;s because then it &apos;s coming back .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i described .
and that &apos;s this projection of vision , rückkopplung , looking .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
that &apos;s the time of most perceptions we have .
the less i kind of think about it , the more more it is .
i want to share with you a particular aspect of curiosity .
and because we get older , the eyelids are getting bigger .
this is what it says , the more you get more umbringst .
did you hear something about überbevölkerungsproblemen from trees ?
you can only have nullemissionen if you &apos;re not there .

these are sechsundzwanzig countries that control 40 percent of the world &apos;s population .
that means it &apos;s efficiency , not about efficiency .
everything in life is not efficient .
when you put the wrong things , you have a müllproblem .
if you walk , yes , everybody destroys the ground .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
because we don &apos;t make things more free .
when i was a interpretin , i first have the geschriebenen notes .
the notierten notes have the function of the letters of a script .
the work of the interpreten begins similar to the sort of a theaterregisseurs .
i play erklärend , what these sounds might have to mean .
i &apos;m going to take the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
and then the same thing happens in a good , angeregten conversation .
i &apos;m never going to play anything like that moment .
i wonder that you often forget something quite extraordinary .

or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
so please listen to a music when a music is played .
there was still no sign at all as an instrument .
and also , what you &apos;d think of today in mind .
that &apos;s the first year of half his value .
and then stone rocks , so he versperrt them .
from that time , an anecdote that you may know .
the person is supposed to be abstammen by the monkey or a common ancestor .
they feel that &apos;s the real truth behind .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples of this .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum whole , many ideas .
they were all kfa , too , also called kfa .
because a good engineer is either building great cars or atomkraftanlagen .
it &apos;s naturally from asia , in the case of japan .
and we can deal with this big battery at two milliseconds .
and then you see the enormous amount of power there .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
so you could feel that you could sell it .

he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensiv , not intense .
we &apos;re not realisten , we &apos;re genießer . we are lover .
this is that , arbeitserfahrung zurückgreift zurückgreift .
because they are the ones who are experts for taste .
and i immediately see a different pattern that is available .
you can test it for my talk in your suite .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
so i can zoom in in the course of my course in a moment .
but in the meantime , i actually wanted to hinabtauchen the titanic of the titanic .
this is the truth . this is not the studio .
this was not a movie , no hd , that was real .

you have to be willing to take risks like that .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
people here contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
it &apos;s renewables , as they &apos;re often called .

one &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
the uranium is used gradually , a little bit like a candle .

they spend a lot of their time in the zusammenbau structure .
konstrukteure , this kind of collaboration as the core of a iterativen vorgangs .
ceos are something above average , but here &apos;s interesting .
this is what happened . not a team had a tough structure .
that &apos;s the same , bad team of one under the best .
so , there should be better one at the beginning of my todeszahl .
and soon , i was writing an article about gentechnisch food .
ask questions , ask the evidence , demand evidence .
number of studies were done to see if this was true .
huge studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
has one ever seen a person in the audience die ?
no fear , no qualen , kinderlähmung , disappeared .
he has just developed a rotavirus-impfstoff with a couple of other people .
what about kinderlähmung ? let &apos;s do that . why not ?
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our healthcare system is mies .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .

i hope you &apos;ll be proud of it . thank you .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
and my talk today is mainly about these cognitive falling .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
these are actual patients who participate with painful procedure .
from the point of view itself , b was clearly a lower time .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
so you can ask : how happy is that the erlebende self ?
we know something about what the happiness is doing .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we were looking at how emotions vary with income .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s 2,500 years ago .
there are these ancient cubes , from schafsknöcheln . you know ?
it was an extreme situation . it took an extreme solution .

this is the world of the wild bonobos in the urwald of congo .
just if it &apos;s not appropriate , it may seem like a game game game .

and as conventional term , we can use the word intersexualität .
and the nebennieren are androgene , which are virilisierende hormones .
if you didn &apos;t move , you &apos;ve buried it .
we &apos;re going to find other merkwürdigkeiten about what their rights are .
but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position .
now in practice , people are not going to test their chromosomes .
i mean , what &apos;s somebody going to do with so many outfits ?
i brought in seven microprocessors , and that &apos;s all .
and i just want to show you my favorite story for this week .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
if you &apos;re happy , you put other people .

i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
they interact in distinct ways with their environment and their experiences .

now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .

politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
when a neighbor helps the other , we use our communities .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
what is this new condition that the world would take slowly ?

and these two worlds just pop together , new and old thinking .
but it &apos;s not on the local level , but on a global level .
but also our perception itself , how makes it possible to us .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting .
because everyone talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphor-problem .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , goes off .
so the question is , how do we deal with these queries ?
here &apos;s one of the proof that men are not pigs .
you can only be klimaneutral if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
and in particular , first of all , to ask what the right thing is .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
the things that are used only are going to work in technical systems .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really do .
that &apos;s also , in every store , you can zurückkriegen things .
so , we don &apos;t need to be klimaneutral , we can be klimapositiv .
you studied the works that he did before and after .
how were his environment , how the society and politics ?
he asked me what the introduction of this ballade was for me .
if that happens , the student gets the nächstschwierige piece .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
the melody comes from the gesungenen and the rhythm from the dance .
so a little bub , that &apos;s not interested in the feuerlöschen .
this is now a dreisatz that describes a logic .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
the first sentence is , klaus claims , there &apos;s no soul .
and if i have right , it &apos;s a man .
if i don &apos;t right , it &apos;s not a man .
secondly , if he &apos;s got right , he has no soul .
the buridansche esel is a esel , which is made from pure nature .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to be in the haystack .
i &apos;ve been working in the collective class 11 years ago .
on this island , this is the island of graciosa on the azoren .
yeah , this is what it looks like at the bottom .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of widerständen and arguments .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
no , because i &apos;m a selbstgerechter genießer and gutmensch .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentiniern .
and so 1982 , a spanish company bought the land in 1982 .
i asked him how to become such a fisch-experten .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t do your fish ? &quot;
it &apos;s the last defense before something in the body .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
and who sees that it &apos;s true to men .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
so i decided to become 15 , diver .
and it was an experience that i couldn &apos;t give in hollywood .
and i &apos;m flying with a little roboterfahrzeug through the gänge of the ship .
we &apos;re just playing the costs . it &apos;s not a trace .
our imagination is a force that can even create reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than any of the world &apos;s lorbeer .
it &apos;s about five tons of tons on the planet .
and somehow we need to make changes that reduce it at zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
usually , you &apos;re just going to be next and some others , and some others don &apos;t .
now , i wondered , how can i really get this ?
now , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of companies .
if we go back from there , how should the 2020 look at 2020 ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
usually , most people are starting to engage themselves against the task .
so i offered a 10000 prize prize for the winners .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in this can go to marshmallowchallenge.com .
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wunschdenken .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against kinderlähmung . no way .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a kinderlähmung . and you know what ?
echinacea , a little antioxidantium that helps you on the front line .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
and then people could not get the food and would be blind .
a deception is going to be something , because somebody will do it like this .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all that it is .
this is my skin . this is not a spezialeffekt from hollywood .
i know what people think when they see it .
this is really my skin . this is not a spezialeffekt from hollywood .
we &apos;re going to go back to the next few days .
they were asked to report all the 60 seconds of their pain .
it &apos;s a story that is auszeichnet , significant moments and ends .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost forever .
it will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
and i don &apos;t mean only less successful , even though that is .
how can we transfer these feelings from playing into reality ?
so the zusammenspielen is allowing the rise of bonds to grow , trust , trust .
players love to be part of awe gebietender &apos;s heroic missions .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
it &apos;s a online-spiel , where you have to overcome a ölknappheit .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
we degradieren a person who has value to our society .
ah , the majority . i like to as a doctor .
i wanted us to have a long and healthy life .
when we get vorausblicken , these kinds of changes are increasingly possible .
that &apos;s actually the real melting of human and machine .
there are 68 million people in the world sitting in the wheelchair .
he said , &quot; carrie , you have to go into the house .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
so here we see a young female and male male males .
only i think it &apos;s more likely to be , not true .
so sexspiele are common , both by bonobos and in humans .
to make us adapt to a unbeständige world , we need to play .
as a consequence , the body develops more to the typical female course .
if the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
okay , just one more quick example of a variation of intersexualität .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualismus .
and it makes me angespannt in terms of thinking about democracy .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening to the gründungsvätern .
and so they have a really wonderful way to have the future civil rights .
so how are we going to ask the question of the character ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
this is what we call our lab , wahrnehmbares design .
halbzeit , people make a short call , go on toilets .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
imagine that every single one of people is being run .
it &apos;s a physikalisches form in london , but covered with bildpunkten .
it explodes about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very archaisch , how can this be ? &quot;
now , each paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes , or draw .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempts room .
we geneigt his bed , so that he can see him outside .
and that keeps us , and we &apos;re always going to continue to develop .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a very similar one .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one deserves us .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
almost as if we prepare our lives for our lives .
i was given the miracle of not dying in this day .
the gray boxes you see here are echtzeit-kontrollsysteme .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
and in fact , this false piece of data has been recorded by stuxnet before .
and when they &apos;re endangered , they can really do bad things .
and if you do that , eventually you get a cyber- massenvernichtungswaffe .
thank you for having a heidenangst eingejagt . thank you ralph .
but even beyond that , it &apos;s a very good mediale opportunity .
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever . &quot;
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
and just like that companies disappeared , one after another .
so maybe you should be a little bit of this interview . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of grautöne and so stuff .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was ausliefere .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed an expert .
this is what i did . the first painting is a picture of my family .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
what is the machete ? what puppenstadium are you right now ?
it &apos;s actually just a time of two and a half weeks ago .
one of the big spoon , we &apos;re welcome the risk .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
if the museum gave us the picture , you click on it .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion bildpunkte , i think .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
let &apos;s jump fast to moma , again in new york .
well , i &apos;m sometimes playing with them , but not very often .
so here i &apos;m expanding it . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side is .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to break up all of these extensions .
and in the meantime , i was prepared to talk to tedglobal .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and a new city also joins new possibilities for executives .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say thank you ted .
you know how many choices do you make on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
they make more awkward decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; nonsense . &quot;
okay . everyone who &apos;s willing to embrace gary &apos;s &apos;s offer .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; swing . &quot;
you have to make 62 different choices to create your car completely .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
when i start with the simple start , i &apos;m learning how to do it .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours of video uploaded a minute .
rebecca blacks &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
today we don &apos;t just find delight in something , we &apos;re doing .
i knew that she was coming to goodbye .
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding them this morning , &quot; he said .
it &apos;s also a tans mother here in the fourth or five row .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photograph was actually put together .
and yes , i have a job as you might recognize .
but where are the next aed to help this patient ?
and they realized that the city never frei these fire fires .
and what &apos;s inside is what we call bureaucracy .
it &apos;s not politically active , it &apos;s active .
you have to think of the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
now , why do we draw graphs in the technology on semi-logarithmischen curves ?
and that &apos;s every one that uses exactly the same letters and the same code .
so the neurons are the informationsverarbeitungsapparat that are built these zellengemeinschaften .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in the verbindungsmaschine does .
now , all the übriggebliebenen that put the numbers on the best .
and that &apos;s a way of rekombinierens , analog to reproduction . &quot;
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves from themselves .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i found that technology should be possible and not kill .
this piece of 50 years old was the magischste thing for me .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary story for children .
in another chapter , you have to baumrinde fotographieren and tag .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
it would be gewissenlos of us , consciously and gezielt people . &quot;
innovation , creativity , and development isn &apos;t just coming from our heads .
i vertrete these kids who were convicted of very hard punishment .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the gerichtssaal ? &quot;
over the last three decades , the verbrechensrate in america has declined enormously .
this is the fact that it &apos;s often put in a context of the elevated population .
now , in fact , the number of gewaltverbrechen doesn &apos;t change very much .
the basis of a lot of this is creating technologies , and these grow expotentiell .
that &apos;s the result of faster computers building faster computers .
scarcity is kontextbezogen , and technology is a resource befreiende force .
in 2010 , we just had two billion people connected to each other .
how about a sentence of new , never before gehörter voices .
how about beiträgen that we can &apos;t even predict ?
i want to conclude with a story that really excites me .
we are on the top side and we move to the world cup .
that means that the player will beat three of 10 beats .
at this point , i was born at the kardiologischen service in the kardiologischen service .
you say that you never forget the names of the versterben .
i looked in the rachen and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and he left him .
&quot; do you remember the patient with the gereizten rachen ? &quot;
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat them well .
now , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a marine basin .
and you might remember , you know , &quot; avatar . &quot;
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in a certain way .
and this is one of the three hauptquellen of the existing world today .
mr. jain himself is on a free foot , the aufenthaltsort is unknown .
diginotar is a vollmachtszertifikat from the netherlands -- or was it .
they had sold this program for 280.000 euro to the egyptian government .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
but there &apos;s a hauptunterschied : the transistor was only for experts .
the idea behind littlebits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
lights , sound , solarelemente , motors -- everything should be available .
in 1957 , five missionare were trying to pick up contact and made a schwerwiegenden mistake .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of forests , which was amazing .
it will not cause the reality of reality , but the resolution of reality .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new lebenmöglichkeiten .
modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
this is a realistischerer case . this is a copy of the guardian .
and rick szeliski was done by microsoft research , a very good collaboration .
but the spatial orientation of the images is actually meaning in fact .
this is actually a poster by notre dame , which was actually recorded .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
i &apos;m going to give you a few examples of what modern progress is .
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t get myself wrong .
these organisms can be completely ausgetrocknet , they can even live in the vacuum .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are lots of things out there .
you &apos;ve seen corn corn recently , which is just a bad experiment .
it changes co2 in methane around the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
it turns out to the wires , and the wires suddenly hit widerstand resistance .
i think it &apos;s better if we encourage our big creative stuff to live .
i have to tell you , i think that was a great mistake .
it &apos;s still for your contribution to your contribution .
i believe that , and i feel like we should teach .
in a certain sense , the arctic eiskappe is the beating heart of our global klimasystems .
and one reason is , this enormous heat footprint is flowing from the north .
this austrocknung in the world leads to a dramatic increase on fire .
the united states is one of those two largest verschmutzer , along with china .
it &apos;s affordable and liebenswert , and workers stay in food and bread .
in the coalergy , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
versorge america + 100 percent cleaner electricity in the next 10 years
you connect it with a particular note , and then you get it to punch .
so , actually , this has just zweitausend eight times , actually , these networks .
so the device you see there is not working .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a small trip .
we &apos;re still being arrested as a informationsvermittlung , very strong .
and that &apos;s what i had over the last half year .
so i was busy busy when it &apos;s of course , or intuitively .
the next generation of graphischen benutzungsoberflächen is very much more with behavior .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as first .
we could , of course , reduce 10 percent reduction , but what does that do ?
because the phosphorus is being emitted to the pigs over the stable components .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , to be more harmful .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil where we get the nutrients back .
in the very same way , we can use nutrients in agriculture .
so we don &apos;t have to be able to control people , so little bad .
a woman in germany eats about six kilograms in her lifetime .
that &apos;s why you help with , ask questions about the people .
there are a lot of people working there , and they can all be engaged .
there are extra people who are cradle-to-cradle-verein , where everyone can follow .
the composer is becoming more and more and more to the friend .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
you learn to find the notes on the instrument on the instrument .
now why am i asking by my audience that it &apos;s also actively listening to ?
because the music is a language , and it &apos;s a language for communicating .
a piece of artwork that you never see has no force .
and so they get up to what they &apos;ve just imagined in the spirit .
i say , ulf , what are you going to need ?
and as i say the word justice , this visceral feeling is gone .
you can try that with words like revenge or gewinnsucht or ähnlichem .
one day , this mirrors says , yes , there &apos;s a schönere .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s wife of worchester .
she likes to enjoy it , because he has a tendency to aufrichtigkeit .
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
although i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
now , i want to argue with you what we found in my institute .
it &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t matter stop , tangible nature .
that &apos;s how to lie that they can just apply this logic wrong .
but the key is , if i have right , it &apos;s true .
and now our sense of consciousness may seem to be able to make sense of it .
it has to do with that that we go back into the vierzehnte century .
when you get more windkraft , the system begins to fail .
there are always three of the dieseln , two of them are always going to be waited .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
if you put it somewhere , it takes a while .
i said , &quot; well , what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
i said , &quot; well , how much percent of wood is chicken ? &quot;
he came to the table with a bright , white white color .
who can make a fish taste so well after he got verkocht ?
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , they didn &apos;t work economically .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fischeiern to the birds .
oh , and by the way , these flamingos were not even going to be there .
it has evolved throughout evolution to unreinheiten aufzusaugen . &quot;
so what we see here is a typical sterbediagramm after age .
and from here , i can go into the side and call them back .
and then we did , and we managed to take a advantage for a while .
this is incredibly important . it &apos;s a good aufhänger for marketing . &quot;
and i noticed how much these tiefseetauchgänge , a weltraummission similar .
i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i get these expeditions .
no glory , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
and we became a viereinhalb family for a viereinhalb family .
nasa has such a lieblingssatz : &quot; fail ain &apos;t an alternative . &quot;
not a major endeavor , the innovation , has been given to the risk of risk .
co2 is affecting the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
it turns out that if you can get that to zero .
because , although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
you &apos;re going to say , you &apos;re nuts . that &apos;s good .
but while they talked to various people in the world about these possibilities .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for a lot later .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , as little as it &apos;s supporting .
you put an administrator administrator on the team , you &apos;re getting significantly better .
so , isn &apos;t it interesting that high rates have a strong effect ?
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
we &apos;re talking ironic about this , with little quotes : &quot; progress . &quot;
and they can do that because they &apos;re not connecting cause and correlation .
we love to hüllen ourselves . we love that .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
and that , although none of them have any pharmazeutische ... it &apos;s just zuckerpillen .
if you take feathers , they &apos;re more effective than a celebration of every form .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
or , &quot; how did your journey go to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s suffered from both of them ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the erinnrung .
end is very , very important and in this case , the end .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories .
well , these are three weeks , and these are just a half hours .
now , the two types of self throw out two terms of happiness .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
we know that money is very important , making goals very important .
this is a player who is on the verge of a epischen sieges .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons : two reasons .
here are the four things that i found . first of all , dringlichkeits-optimismus .
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more überschwänglich .
we play a game to escape the real world &apos;s suffering .
they were playing a würfelspiel , and the best was able to disrupt a epischen adventure .
they were playing würfelspiele for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
we &apos;ve developed the game called superstruct at the institute for the future .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me like this , and play with me .
so again , change and customization are the greatest skills of people .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and the a high school teacher will get harder tested , get the better teachers and so on .
the very important thing about this study was that the teachers weren &apos;t eingeweiht .
what would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
a few . probably about this as many creative people here .
evolution priviligiert the creatures that adapt to their environment .
but there &apos;s a third chance , a verlockende , fascinating and terrifying opportunity .
would you not want to do this change in your genes ?
the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , which is anzahl .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of human evolution in human evolution .
it wasn &apos;t surprised that this destruction also is keeping the survival of the bonobos .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives long .
first of all , a ballspiel on bonobo-art -- and i don &apos;t think of fussball .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s no test .
we have two creatures , both the middle 1979 of the exact day .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand on flohmärkten and in second-hand-shops .
what &apos;s interesting today is the echtzeit-kontrollsysteme is beginning to appear in our lives .
well , this night , all of the center to celebrate .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and we got the assignment to design the expo of the expo .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s inside .
on the left-hand side , you see the bildpunkte , the different eingefangenen sensations .
and just like that , the iceberg show you another side of his personality .
my life is really blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
so we have created a device that &apos;s completely free of constraints .
we set up a projektor belt against the hospital in front of the hospital .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you today .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never seen each other as adults .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and this gave us great confidence for that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t easy .
and we were very often running into a dead and we had to rebuild ourselves .
the idea of this is obviously not just the maschinenbediener in the control room .
we need to make the consequences and we &apos;re getting better at us .
so despite this warning , i knew that somebody was going to buy the namensrechte .
these guys will be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you a ausfühliche version .
what is it that &apos;s related to the thought and feelings of itself ?
are you something that a little bit calm , reservierter , conservative ?
are they established , traditionally , pflegend , beschützend , compassionate , compassionate ?
big data will be transformed for organizations around the world in large opportunities .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or so .
but at the same time , we need a good share of intuition to actually do experiments .
i remember seeing a child playing on a bodenschwelle .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
they &apos;re just building the building of apartments to the city .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december in december of a hill in miami .
the other place that was interested in the urbanism is singapore .
a million people are leaving latin america and migrate to the united states .
how good , do you think they &apos;re making decisions in it ?
and we found that there was actually a correlation .
you know , the average supermakrt today gives you 45,000 products .
every single one of you could be about the internet until saturday .
because you just do that , if you &apos;re called yosemite mountain mountain .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also freitage .
a schuluniform to the knöcheln , because it had to be six years .
before i talk to the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
i looked through the duschtrennwand and seeing it on the other side .
in order to midnight , the monk and said he had to close the tombstone .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , in front of berechtigungsanspruch .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
maybe it &apos;s familiar to you , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 follower on twitter .
and they can do that by doing things like this , but also by scratch .
we know exactly where all the atms are around maastricht .
so , what did we do ? we conducted in the netherlands .
how did he get to search for this particular kind of aid ?
they were there in february , and it has last february of february .
it &apos;s a nice little app , where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and not even like a technik-unternehmen , but rather like the internet itself .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government than i started this program .
you usually get out of your town when you &apos;re in your city .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government , until we improve the citizenship .
this is a slide that i happen to be selected from my folder .
in other words , every step here is an power in the leistungsskala .
and this is what i want to look at on the zeitskala of life on earth .
it &apos;s the reason why it grows to antibiotics .
we have lots of cells that are not on their own .

and i talked to the oil industry recently , and they said that this is the model of exactly verstünden .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phrases , thoughts .

they &apos;re dreadful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about them .
i &apos;m talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .

and then you &apos;d suddenly recognize how it would be if you couldn &apos;t talk to your own language .

and what it does is it makes people walk into the business and ask this question .
with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very difficult to decide .
and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , it never happens .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m quite sure we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time on the choice of our good good .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes , from the 500 or something that &apos;s here .
so we had to develop a new way of combining these little pieces that were able to make the mistakes .
obviously , it &apos;s a very simple virus . it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge .

all you have to say is &quot; make words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
i have to go back to this little bit , and it &apos;s just a little bit of ausholen with modern molecular biology .
extremely important is now extremely important , and much more importantly , much more importantly in the future .
and it &apos;s about a playful creative , creative , original way to solve a problem .
you need biological materials , of course , and you need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
and then you can speed up the particles strong enough , and then you go into the onion .
so , as citizens as citizens in the situation , it &apos;s going to be versetzt with these scientific technologies .

at the same time , i was also very interested in weltraumwissenschaft , which was back to the science-fiction-einfluss of my childhood .
but in the art and studying , it needs to be an alternative , because it has to be a vertrauensvorschuss .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
these are very good things , and armutsverringerung means to make these services accessible to almost every one on the planet .

a few years ago , at ted , peter skillman hired a design-wettbewerb called &quot; the marshmallow-herausforderung . &quot;
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design-workshop .
as peter said , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .

if you have 10 teams , the typical approach , you get about six , which have robust structures .
they have shaped the demographics of the earth in a way that has no war ever done .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of scientific technology .

is this something that you can let us participate for , because now you have a few minutes left ?
60,000 dollars in a year , people are unhappy , and they become more happy , ever more attractive .
people are in the process to confirm that they should think of happiness as they think about politics .
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft that offers the ideal environment to the collective problem .
where they also go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to show their epic mission .
so many people are now in the world at least one hour per day with online-spielen .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good in what &apos;s in whatever .
so i started thinking , what is it that these games are doing to us ?
there was such a great famine that the king had decided to be a crazy idea .

it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and increase my strength and resilience .

the big digital sprengkopf -- we got a glimpse , by looking at the data , and we looked at it .
so here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- it really made me break out of my socks .

they push the decision -- push them up , even if they &apos;re interested in their own best interest .
those who really want to make a choice will be offered , not 300 or more fund .
the one on the left is jazz and the right on the right side , but you know what ?
the only thing i did is to change the order of that information .
because i believe that the key to best choice is that you choose to choose .
today , we want to talk about how video videos are going to be viral , and then , why is that important .

so in other words , the future is shrunk every year since i &apos;m on this world .
and every time it divided , they spread into the chemikalien of chemicals .
so the nervous system has the evolutionsprozess system with this particular informationsstrukturen , because evolution could now happen within an individual .
and what we actually did , we , the humanity , is we &apos;ve started to abstrahieren .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the ancient indian epos &quot; mahabharata . &quot;

verarmten imagination , a kurzsichtige view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i first read it .
but the more i thought about that , the more i came to the view of the fish .

stuxnet , like a laborratte , who didn &apos;t like our cheese cheese -- schnüffelte , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
and after we &apos;ve been experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to that this is a gezielter attack .
so , in the great and all we &apos;re really confident that we actually have what the goal is .
so it &apos;s kind of like in hollywoodfilmen , where the überwachungskamera is fed up with vorher videoaufnahmen .

she grew up at a time when the social norm , the social norm , was the most important person .

so for me , it seemed to me to go on photography at the right place at the right time .
and yes , i even have the house on the top of the island of red to make it look french .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .

and then seattle decided to use seattle to use the authority to get the citizens to clean the verstopften .
it was about a way of trying to figure out what the right public schools are for their children .
and how many people , i thought it was mainly about the government to choose people in office .

the united states of america is the only country in the world , the dreizehnjährige children to death in jail .
in south africa , people understood that the rassentrennung is not too disconnected without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity , with humanity , compassion and justice .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the evolution .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i started a new university here at ted university called singularity university .

the first betonblocksteine were made , and entstammten of a simple idea : stacks of cement with festgelegten measured that fit .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
lego basically has the betonbaustein , the building block of the world , and made a block for our imagination .
like the betonblock , the transistor allows us to build much greater , more complex , more complex , one pebble after another .
instead of that you have to program , verdrahten or löten , you have to allow them to code with simple , intuitive gestures .
i grew up in the forests of britisch columbia and believed that these forests are there to be gerodet .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .

triplets of this letter -- these letters are about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .

and it &apos;s just nurmale selection . we can go to lebensfähigkeit , production of chemicals , of chemicals , and so on .
but to be fair -- the group of chemists don &apos;t receive the reputation of alkoholsüchtigen menschen people .
from socrates , it &apos;s known that he believed he would have a dämon that he made out of himself .

he then got this one helmet there , and in the cooperation with the museum , it ran .
now , we think of our love to stories depends on us as a child on the lap of our parents .
and this game is connecting the virtual world , so the data that we produce , that we create with the real world .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see .
so a lot of natural , in a cabin , but i can see exactly where it is , where is salt and pepper .
and on the left , just intuitive , and then i hope that no sugar is in there , which is the salt .

they &apos;re not zählten because he was with a memory , and the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .

we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t have the real world yet .
and imagine that i &apos;ve even been a fünfjähriges child with dr. p. , and so trying to stop this practice , natürllich without success .

and as we talk about bacteria , you realize that every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than the cells in the rest of our bodies ?
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t easy , but led and decided to be a individuen. in the decisions we make .
play is a formwandler , and it can take a lot of shapes from which some of which are quiet , phantasievoll , curious -- maybe to discover the surprise again .

i want you to imagine two pairs , in the middle of 1979 , at the exact same day , in exactly the same moment , every single child -- all right .

now , when it comes to us , the systems that control and valves control , we can actually make a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
and i called them , and they know their knowledge to compare their expertise , what we found in the code and in the data .
and if you manipulated the speed of this rotors , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor and then actually explodieren the centrifuge .
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are a part of life , actually , to bring them to the film ?
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that has a negative konnotation -- but you know how to evolve ?
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet , but i think it &apos;s worth worth , some really know , some really familiar brands .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes a positive thing , unlike &quot; fighting odor and moisture . &quot;

but you could go to a completely new place , build a whole new block block , vorausgesetzt the laws of the rules that are going to support it , and not behindern it .
unfortunately , it &apos;s sometimes children who are trying to find their parents , who they have , in some cases , since a decade ago , haven &apos;t seen .
so what &apos;s it for an idea to insist on that every family has a choice between hundreds of cities that are in competition for new people ?
and now i give you a couple of seconds to read them , and i ask them to clap , if they &apos;re willing to adopt gary &apos;s .

when i was a kid , the future was somewhere in the year 2000 and people talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , we have a pretty good picture of how they do it .
so we take something very complicated , turns it into sound , a sequence of sound , and make something very complicated in the heads of others .
and it all connects us to something that is much greater , and it &apos;s also able to continue to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
i know and i &apos;m sure that they &apos;re going to do the job , because they come from a series of hunderttausenden programs that have done the job .
we bring our kids closer and closer to the natural world and to the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
she took me out , and she said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t have it . &quot;

and every year we ask the students to create companies , products and services that can affect the lives of billions of people &apos;s lives .
and then their pupils expand , they came back in front of the head , and they go down and they &apos;re difficult to tell , and they start telling their stories .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in sophisticated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
we want to be the creators of creators , the inventor , the mitwirkenden , because this world , in which we live , is this interactive world .
now there are some of us who forget that , if i say , &quot; different possibilities of his , &quot; really different possibilities of his own .

most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the kongressbibliothek and it &apos;s in a region of 300 megapixeln .
and this is something that that people use with the complexity that people use , and they use it and use for the user use of the user .
when people have freedom , each of us is about to do things that maximize our good good , and no one has to decide for us .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions independent from whether that means to make all the tasks that i share with you and not good grade in my class .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
and i have argued that we may be able to create a new form of kambrischen explosion in which it could be massive new artenbildung based on this digital design .
i think that it &apos;s so hard that it &apos;s so hard to reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
and what &apos;s happening to the creative enterprise is that they &apos;re unsicher us over the state of mind -- in a way that other jobs don &apos;t do ?
this is brilliant -- there is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct to protect you from your work .
it &apos;s kind of very sad for the hackerszene , because that &apos;s not what it is that it actually has started , and what it &apos;s actually about .
another thing from the united states , which has just to do with this vaterschaftstestgeschichte there , is the p.c.r , which is the polymerase-kettenreaktion , complicated word .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap yet , but it &apos;s definitely in a framework where it &apos;s clearly available .
and if you want to make a bürger citizen in society , and you want to be able to make a gesellschaft , you want to have access to knowledge and technology .
and this one of the virtual forces that the virtual change is the reality that people have also had required in the vorindustriellen times , because they had nothing .
and as you can see , this is a very inselreiches area , and you had to kind of navigate , from island to island to get food .

very direct ads , not for the company puma , but for that they &apos;re now helping this company to help these products .

and yes , a lot of what &apos;s been said today , i &apos;m very , very , very , because many , many beautiful statements that i have lived in .
as big as big , it would be such a battery , so that you can get an island in 20 , 30 , 40 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and if you want to go about 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , it &apos;s not the performance at the moment , then you have to turn off the ozone .
that our system also has a preisanstieg , it &apos;s because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent of petrol , and we don &apos;t have a preissteigerung on the other .

it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .

so , gender is really complicated ; intersexuelle are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can spread across the whole range .
and one of the things that i really found interesting about is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operate in the world .
and because they haven &apos;t heard me from me as the woman who walk around here at ted in her underwear -- that is , i found a couple of things .
we found one for them , we took them , and we took care about them , and we gave them eight , because it needed it , because it was necessary .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most powerful part , the dropper- part , he made a schwachstellen of unzähligen day- .
and if you &apos;ve heard that the dropper of stuxnet complex and high-tech is , let me tell you , the nutzdaten are a science for themselves .
and i spent 30 days doing nothing to eat this -- spaßig at the beginning , a little hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
what i &apos;d like to do is a film about product placement , marketing , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is being funded by product , marketing and advertising .

so the first case : all the trillions of atoms made out of the piece of metal , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving at the same time , and down the same atoms .
so if a single atom can be at two different places at the same time , this piece of metal can be two different places , why don &apos;t you ?
i loved to go to this business , but at a time , i asked myself , well , how come you can never do anything ?
it also puts me excited about the great product that i zusammenstelle , and so i &apos;m willing to get myself interested with interest .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , family , relatives , &quot; how does it go ?

and when i was able to hear her chest with the stethoskope , i could hear a knackendes sound on both sides that told me that she was suffering under kongestiver failure .

and i went back through the same tortur of shame and self-doubt , and i was struck by the work , and went back to work until again and again and again .

well , of course , in a kind of spark such accidents , these accidents are the debate about the value of science and ingenieurskunst in such boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject it .
because it makes a lot of sense as much as everything that i &apos;ve heard about when it came to explain the absolute crazy launenhaftigkeit of the creative process .
but then he got older and calm . he told me that he was driving one day in los angeles , and there it changed everything for him .

some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula , you took your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
so i came up with the need for just a check , and instead i put a check from which i didn &apos;t have the slightest idea of how i was supposed to be .

and i started thinking scientific literature about how these zentrifugen were built in natanz , and found that they are strukturiert in what &apos;s called kaskaden , and each kaskade contains 164 zentrifugen .

because , in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also , they don &apos;t have a chance to get there .
so that means that alarm , if you know that now , pay attention to who you look like for a long time , because i don &apos;t have any gewähr for what can happen .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to be able to go home four hours , but your employer , or anyone , you know , you &apos;ve got to do it with the four hours .
and when you get people to be able to live the people when you say it , if you say it would be better , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be raffgierig and feindselig .
at this point , when you laugh , you see how important this lie is , and how much time you need to learn something that artists can tell us .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything yourself and you want to be happy , if you want to make people happy , this courage to practice .
i &apos;m grateful to be grateful that he had the word again , because after the mauerfall , you didn &apos;t use the word anymore , because everything left was bad .

some people say you shouldn &apos;t be working on the insurance because you &apos;re going to be the insurance , so you &apos;re going to eat , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the herzoperation .
but because that &apos;s not what &apos;s happened here , we can do it in denial , and people like jenny , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and have messages from fear and larry king live .
but i think in this frame here , and with the purpose of doing a real thing , i &apos;ll just leave the needle there and go from the stage .

today , we can for the first time -- and the campaign obama showed this -- we can move from the digital world , from the digital forces of networks to the physical world .

i just want to deal with him and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be able to communicate with this stuff ? &quot;
but if we can do it that an effective competition on a laptop is used by a wartungsingenieur , to konfigurieren these gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at a tedtalk in the world of branding and sponsoring , i knew i would do something slightly different .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i &apos;m going to do something with museums and art and art . my favorite , which is now , i gave me green light .

i had to make sure it wasn &apos;t for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was happening to us , but we kept it .
every dollar has been assigned , and it was put into more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we were allowed to do , mostly the new things that came out of the second hand .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play together , to make any kind of play to control their health better .
so they have survived either , or they went together . that meant that when a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were more often repeated and dependent upon evolution .
it &apos;s this kopf-herz-verbindung that i think is that it drives us not just to be open for all the bright and begeisternden things , but also for the dark and problematischen .
there are no barriers to technology and design that allows us to be fully human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , ausgrenzung and injustice .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could be the last six days , or the last six days .
they use tools like the staatstrojaner to bespielen their computer with a trojaner that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their online-diskussionen abzuhören , to collect their passwörter .
here &apos;s a photograph i took in the northern end of the baffin-inseln , when i went to the narwhal-jagd , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant goals of earth , that they &apos;re not at all .
they represent parts of the human imagination in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our own children &apos; dreams , are part of the geography of hope .
and of course , all of these are the enormously wealthy virtual models of any interesting part of the earth , which is not only by überflüge or images and so on , but by collective memory .
and then you go to the verbraucher-elektronik business for a stereo -- speaker , cd-player , a kassetten-player , radio , verstärker , and in this one electronics , there are so many stereo facilities .
work -- we &apos;re blessed as carl , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every single minute on the planet -- to the randolph hotel .
it &apos;s a picture of the first strahlenpartikels , which is the entire track around the lhc , then defined with a part of the lhc to allow a rain of particles on the detector .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m going to talk about now from the world as the work is going to be successful in my last book , right ?
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following . centuries ago in the deserts of the centuries of heiligen people , with holy tänzen and music gathered that were stopped for hours -- until dawn .
an interesting implication of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like the color of schütten , how to do it with liquids .
i &apos;m in closing , and i hope , the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the bachelorarbeit of michael burk , ann-kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan-moritz müller .

when we go back to the site of software , the first command line of interface , which was very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
not to burn a little bit better than to burn , and put it in the verbrennungsanlage , and to lose the whole materials for cycles , but first of all , how do you make cycles ?

i have to say that nathaniel has had a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric and thorazin and handschellen , a trauma that has been pursuing his whole life .
and in the same way , nathaniel was when we started with our first class in walt disney concert hall . he had this irre flackern in his eyes and was completely lost .
and as through a miracle , he took his violin and started to play a couple of snippets of violinkonzerten , and then asked me to play them : mendelssohn , tschaikowski , sibelius .
once the first thing is done , when it comes out like this , it &apos;s all clear , it &apos;s all clear , because the energy density , the energy density is so different than we know it .
except , you know , you &apos;re very short before a kostendurchbruch and funded only the learning . i think we should try more things that have the potential , much less expensive .
it requires that we all have our senses in the task , and that we think we &apos;re going to use our thinking , how our emotions and our do , in the challenge , the challenge of us .
but if you put the shape in which you give the drug care , for example , in a smaller pill , and that blue color , and that blue color , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
so i &apos;m going to suggest , if you &apos;re quick , you &apos;re going to look at the next 30 seconds . or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first heiklen part here in the back .
that &apos;s true for laien , which is your happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists to think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just like the mess like everyone else .
imagine your next holiday , you know , at the end of the urlaubs , all of your images are being wiped out , and you get a amnestisches drug , so you &apos;ll remember nothing .
everybody who &apos;s not going to be different from this terms of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being that have been vermasselt for happiness long in the same way that they have been .
and what happens is , when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , climate .

and to be honest , the only real and enduring disability that i had to get apart is that the world is constantly , it can describe me with these definitions .
if we don &apos;t copyright a human being , and not all of his powers and possibilities , we can see , in addition to the natural struggle that you may need to have , a more disease .
and maybe that change could happen because i &apos;ve met so many people who have opened doors to me , instead of looking at people who wanted to be constrained or me .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are and me like booster rockets to send the genetic fracht into the next stage of orbit to get into the ocean .
and then the analytical technique , the same engine of science that can allow the change to prevent the change , could enable us to prevent disease , could enable us to adopt super-attribute , hyper-kapazitäten -- the better memory .
they &apos;re not anything else that they put in the morning and gives them extra strength , and that &apos;s going to increase their velocity and that will help them keep their balance .

it &apos;s meant to say , there could be something , average , which is female brains of male , which makes us separate to hochkomplexe social relationships , and to worry about the schutzbedürftige .

and the coolste is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s going to be in the middle of this april , in the middle of los angeles , a show called &quot; art of the world . &quot;
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with augenerfassungstechnologie , but i &apos;ve just got some sort of erfasst and surrounded me with amazing people so we could put something on the legs .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
and if you play with your particles , all kinds of weird things -- like you &apos;re going to fly right through walls , or that you can be at the same time at two different places .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of delegation , who meant that we have to make this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way we can get our country forward .
in fact , it &apos;s an objective that you see , the first time more information had more information than the second time , but i would make it a car that they had the second time in the world .
and we ask our colleagues all around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like knotenpunkte , to behave , to make these aeds on the world .
but more importantly to this app is that it represents a new generation that the problem of the government anpackt -- not as the problem of a verknöcherten institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically giving töne sounds of me in the hope of creating a similar verwirrte idea in your head , which has a certain resemblance with my original idea .
i live living from building computers and i know that i &apos;m going to use the mechanism i &apos;m using computers to build computers , without the recently designed in computing technology .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals today to provide the great challenges of our planet .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , defeated the hospital and went to the parking room to drive the car when i did something that i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
and there was another nurse said , not the sister who had seen after women , but another three words to me and those three words are most of the most notfallärzte that i know .
and in fact , when i knew or my colleagues knew that a orthopäde in my hospital would have made somebody the wrong leg , you know , i think , i would have trouble to look at it .
a couple of weeks ago , we went to risd and gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they told them , &quot; what . &quot;
they lifted these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything , and they were töteten , and they killed the fünf of the devil .
you know , we really -- moderate goals like the ersatz of the whole petrochemischen industry . right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where otherwise ? a hauptquelle of energy to become .
my father , for example , was chemists and i can &apos;t remember the situation in his 40 years as a chemist in which he was asked whether he was afraid to be chemists .
it was as if the time came out , and the dancers through a kind of pforte , and he did nothing different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before . but all they put together .

last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic eiskappe , which is the size for nearly three million years , the size of the bottom 48 years is reduced to 40 percent .
and if these tools are physical and awareness of their movements , they can recognize each other and see the edges of our brain with them , then we can start with exploration new and more entertaining interaktionsarten .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do the whole thing on german , because if i had to translate it back to english , it would be appropriate to me with translation of translation of translation .
now , there &apos;s the notes all the other people have as an accurate record of the composer , but only a framework , and i &apos;m going to turn to this framework , to make it sense and meaning .
it &apos;s not too late to start to see if they can &apos;t do it , or learn how to learn how to do these little muscles that put the vocal chords , right ?
and that &apos;s what we do , and in this way , the talk of premium kola , that you may be able to be a collective , and you can use solar energy , a little bit together .
and then i realized , when he says a farm that doesn &apos;t have a unreinheiten , it &apos;s massive , because the water , the water flowing through this farm from the river from the river .
businesses that are not the worlds of themselves , businesses , which are wiederherstellen , rather than aufzubrauchen , , rather than just intense , farmers who are not just making it , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can see websites with it -- and we bring these zoom-technologie to every single website like this .
we actually created six months later a reality in which i was in a russian tauchboot wiederfand , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic .

and in a conversation today with dean kaman , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me the permission -- his technolgie , the &quot; slingshot , &quot; and that many of you may have heard of . it &apos;s got the size of a kühlschranks . &quot;
no biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all the species are removed from extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , this -- this -- the apokalyptischste szenarium on the area of the biological diversity -- is almost not as familiar with what &apos;s known as a optimistischstes .
and that was really , really , very bitter , and then you get into a phase of time , just showing that a picture of durchhalten , where i asked for 10 years , a thousand years ago , a thousand years ago , if that was really the great thing .
i mean , most of the moments of our lives -- and i have that -- you know , the psychological presence is about three seconds long . what is , you know , in a lifetime , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a lifetime . most of you don &apos;t leave in a month . most of you don &apos;t leave .
these people have come to wealth , but they &apos;ve acquired it illegal by using trojaner , for example , to make money out of our bankkonten , while we &apos;re doing our online-banking , while we &apos;re going to buy our online-banking , while we &apos;re buying a computer computer online .
you know , one of the great vernügen in travel , and one of the pleasures at the ethnographischen research , is to live with the people who can still remember the old days . the past , still , in the wind of the plants , taste on the regen of plants .
if one didn &apos;t say that , it was the vetoprinzip , which has a totally zermürbt . i &apos;ve been very hard to see if i could really do my great ingenieurstudium on a schwachsinnige thing , because all the colleagues in my father , you know , you know , you have the window for the window .
this equation has four factors . a little multiplikation . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- which you want to bring out zero and that will depend on the number of people in average , from the service of the service , the average energy for every service of the service and the co2 .
we &apos;re on the verge of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we have to go back to hundreds and hundreds and a half years ago to find a time in which we &apos;ve been fighting progress , in which we &apos;ve been talking about these things .
a couple of years ago , the lasker-preis was awarded by the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took a adults , a fibroblasten , and through the manipulation of only four genes , the cell texture , to be able to return to a brain disorder .
i used to go with a young colleague of 6,000 miles of chengdu in westchina überland through südost-tibet , and only when i came to indonesia , i saw the face behind the statistics of which you hear about the statistics of 6,000 sacred monuments that have been ermordet and asche . 1.2 million people in the cultural revolution .
what i &apos;m going to do first , as quickly as quickly as possible , is to show the basic work , a new technology that we see microsoft as part of a übernahme one year ago . this is a seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment where they can either handle local or large amounts of visual data .
bruce brown , a famous designforscher at the brighton-university , is so far to say that these media designers , it &apos;s the book , and the image , so not television , the internet , and so on what we call the media mass , and the internet and so on .
and if i do this , for example , for example , in which i &apos;m investigating as a single auspräge , selektieren as a choice , it &apos;s going to be big to me , i can look at it , and i can look at it in the details , and i can send it to somebody else , and i can send it to somebody else .

in the early days , i got a really amazing task when my professor asked me if i was interested to go to haiti and infiltrate the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of duvalier and tonton and the toxin that was used to make zombies .
bg : now we haven &apos;t set up to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting offenlegungsregeln for everything that &apos;s &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s great interest and the people of the company in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i &apos;ve talked about it , and i &apos;ve talked to the energieminister .
it &apos;s actually the one that will make decisions , because when you have a patient who , say , two different surgeons , we have two different surgeons , and decide what he &apos;s supposed to vote for , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be selected .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret to the best friend , even though that one on verschwiegenheit and then you get caught and you get the best friend , and i &apos;m going to leave you with a mistake , and i &apos;m going to be a very bad discussion , if you &apos;re at the end of the day .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , or technical innovations , but rather than an era where we were zugegen and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth , the problem is not the change .
and they &apos;ve got two builders , and they said , &quot; well , you know , we &apos;re going to do a simpler and cheaper , and then we &apos;ve got open source of hardware , free hardware , free hardware , diese , and now the billigste of these devices and are now the cheapest anbieter of these devices .

if i was in a room full of with colleagues , and to ask their immediate support and to tell them what i &apos;ve just told you , i would probably not be able to achieve the end of the second story , before it really would give you a joke , and forget the rest of it .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the schreibprozess eat , pray , love of love , and i fell into one of those jets that we all fall when we work on something , and it &apos;s not going to work . you start thinking that this is a disaster . that &apos;s going to be the worst book .
we also have one of these diesel-aggregate in the same size , as it says , in the hall , in order to actually do the full dynamic behavior of this network , so in the hall , it &apos;s now the diesel , here , the große , which is the whole battery that we simulate the web .
if i want to show you one thing today , the total part of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of the parts of the parts of the parts and instead of thinking about it , i think that you can think about how we can use information that could not be visible .
and if you were to choose another holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species and you have to think about how you choose this conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious , because when you think of the time , you can get a answer , and if you think of memories in the sense of memories , you might get a different answer .
this was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i &apos;m doing the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the richest five girls in the hospital in the second floor , but he actually brought me to see my daily übungs-horror with new eyes . so , it was a new and vielversprechendes experience .
this sentence of learning with widrigkeiten lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on the challenge to become a challenge , without becoming the associated with the associated experience of the associated experience , as if my life was so successful , because i could make the possible one of my disability .
we reinigten the chromosome of a mikrobenspezies , and , in fact , these two are the same as human beings and mice . we gave some extra-gene to the chromosome that we were able to choose this chromosome . and it was very amazing as we put it in a cell -- and it was very amazing as we put it in a cell -- and it was very surprising .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models in the past year to do this , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or vernünftigere ideas that are associated with creativity .
down here in the picture , you see the lab , in anführungsstrichen , is so a zugestellte garage , so it &apos;s so much of a laborgerümpel garage , which is a group in paris , a group in paris , a group in paris , and it &apos;s pretty interesting , and also quite interesting , and also quite interesting .
i recommend to read all of you , steves book , and look at the film , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that was between those two men , but also how the music was made , when this pun was made , and how did it make the instrument , when this pun is being made .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time co2 , then the skeptic said , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not going to be an footprint , i wish it wasn &apos;t an footprint , i wish it would be cheaper , but i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s cheaper . &quot;
i had a close encounter in recently , as i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , which was now over 90 , but her whole life , she told me that she was going to be in virginia virginia , and she told me that she would be able to feel like a poem about the landscape of the landscape on her .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to talk about how to deal with widrigkeiten and i &apos;m going to tell you something , that this sentence for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with that , and i think , i think , why .
in other words , zuckerpillen in some studies have shown a measurable effect , which is , in fact , because the person thinks what &apos;s happening to her , is a pharmazeutische or a kind of ... in the schmerzmanagement , for example , when the patient is conscious , it &apos;s a measurable effect in the body that you call the placebo-effekt .
for example , women who anstrebten the wahlrecht anstrebten , the concept of dads , who says , is that they are engaged in common care than the anatomical difference , and they said , &quot; well , we have a uterus and eierstöcke , &quot; which is the law , etc . , etc . , etc .
now , today , if you want to win a race , actually , something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time , have a few thousand sensors that will pass information out of the car , and then use things to go back and do things in real time .
really , some happy people , and companies , for-profit , for-profit and non-profit , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let me go back to the point that they were at the moment that they were not going to see a title .
now we &apos;re all using , or a lot of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in totalitären states like iran , where dissidents ausländische use the anbieter of the world &apos;s anbietern , because they know that they can trust more than local anbietern and that they &apos;re verschlüsselt .
the young akolythen are separated from the age of three and four years from their families , in a schattenhaften world of darkness , at the fuße of the glacier , for 18 years of the glacier , for 18 years of the glacier to mimic the nine months of the pregnancy that they spent on the lap of the pregnant mother .
margaret mead , the great anthropologin said , before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that when we &apos;re moving towards a thread , gestaltlosen , generischen worldview , we &apos;re not only going to see the entire bandwidth of human imagination , but that we have to wake up one day .
the result is -- we call it autonomy autonomy . that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift is a burden of responsibility for somebody who knows about somebody who knows about somebody who knows about somebody who knows how to make a difference and most likely , not in the best condition is a decision .
and that would be their answer to the björn argument that , if you use all of these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that suffer , the armutsverringerung , the armutsverringerung of malaria , the armutsverringerung of malaria and so on , is that it &apos;s a dumb waste of resources that we can do .
in my show , &quot; white art , black art , &quot; i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; and then i &apos;m with the microphone . &quot;
i even with my professor , richard evan shultes , who pointed out the psychedelische of the magic mushrooms with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in mexico , and i said , &quot; well , i said that you couldn &apos;t be there as a halluzinogen . &quot;
i &apos;d like to show you one of the originalen data sets of data from noah , and that &apos;s from a early prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on in the summer to show you what i think really is the punchline of this technology that we have on the site .
and now , in fact , in biology , and i want this metaphor to the metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually a informationswissenschaft , because the d.n.a code is a standard code , because it &apos;s a technical code , because it &apos;s a matter of matter , because it &apos;s a matter of matter , because it &apos;s a matter of matter .
and so there are different , but the nice thing about this is that there &apos;s a million times a million times as much energy as one , say , a kohlemolekül and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re mostly the radiation , the footprint and the cost of the matter of the country , and the costs , is what makes the potential .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all kinds of batteries that are made , looking at cars , computers , cell phones , for everything , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been able to do with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , and i found out that all the batteries that we produce now , i found out that all the batteries that we produce now .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states of the old südens , we have people -- here &apos;s the risk to death to death , 11 times higher , if the victim is white , when it &apos;s black . 22 times , if it &apos;s black , and the victim knows -- in the same states , where the erde is .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of dringenden problems to invest in something that you only have later -- and that comes out that investment is not so clear , in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there &apos;s people in the rich world , and there are people in the rich world .
so i went home , and i went to dinner with my wife and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use to use your eyes to control things that you can use to control your eyes , you should find a way that you can make a laser . &quot;
it &apos;s not a lot of space in the malariaverseuchten of asmat , or the cold winds of tibet , but still , through time and ritual and ritual a mystery of the earth &apos;s ritual , which is not based on the idea of being aware , but in a far more subtileren intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because of the human mind .
it means that a little kid from the andean ridge , which is in the belief that the mountain is a apu-geist , which is a apu-geist , or your destiny , will be a very different person , and a different relationship to this resource , or this place , as a little child in montana , can get a lot of stones .
now let &apos;s step back to the big bang of the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living organisms , perhaps three to four or four billion years ago -- and then the human species , perhaps , are as much as 800 billion years ago .
if someone has done it , and all of these saints identified , and mitteilt , who they &apos;re all , then my photo of the notre dame-kathedrale suddenly angereichert all of this data , and i can use it as a point of opportunity to go into this room , and i can use it as a kind of übergreifender to put in this room , in this room , in this room .
well , if you &apos;re one of those who doesn &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time , you &apos;re going to take your personal kommunikationsgerät -- i &apos;ll give you the erlaubnis -- and maybe you can take a look at glamour , and maybe you can take a look at glamour .
so that the system has evolved to create the backups , which makes it easier to find out that people are inevitable , and it &apos;s also allowed to make fun , supporting spaces , where everybody who is going to be able to make health care , which is actually being rewarded , and that &apos;s really likely to be belohnt , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be rewarded .
when you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglas , the schallschwächung , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human leistungsvermögen , if you &apos;re working on sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain the other thing , and you know , you know , that you can &apos;t explain somebody else . that &apos;s like the police officer .
really , i found that he had collected my entire childhood in my entire childhood , whether i &apos;d won in a buchstabier-wettbewerb in the second grade , whether i was traveling with the pfadfindern at the parade , whether i had to win my scholarship or a sportlichen , and he was using the ausschnitte to teach his students , medizin-studenten medical school .
usually my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies are , and i thought , and i thought , because i &apos;m here , i &apos;m going to be able to tell you what i really think is going to be , and i &apos;m going to be able to see what &apos;s really going on , and i &apos;m going to try and see what &apos;s going on .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with the real objects -- with my fachberater patti and my colleague jeevan , i started to wonder : what if we could use computers , instead of a maus-zeigers , which is like , what if we could do it ?
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the penan in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo-akolythen in haiti , or the warrior in the kaisut-wüste of nordkenia , the curanderos , or the mitten in the middle of the sahara , or a karawanserei in the middle of the sahara , or a karawanserei in the middle of the sahara .
a riesenerfolgsgeschichte , but again , we have the problem of a growing company , and we then have zweitausendsechs , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to go back and look at the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what i think is so crazy , and that is , again , is crazy , that we &apos;re going to talk about the fact that people are not going to go .
i &apos;m going to leave my abschließenden words to a english scientist . humphrey davy , who , as i guess , as he was using the nutzlosen experiments of his lehrlings , was his apprentice , he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , &quot; he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind . &quot;
at this point , what &apos;s going to be said is , &quot; what happens when we have a unbesiedelte area of our country , what if we just geben- a message of the american embassy , a part of the canadian botschaft- , and when people want to go to the united states , they can do anything in the canadian rules , and they can go to the surface of the country . &quot;
and we have a series of trips to the ethnosphäre , where we take our audience to places that cultural wonders , that they &apos;re blinded by the gesehenen , and hopefully , you &apos;re going to take one after the rest of the offenbarung of the subject , that the world is able to be able to be able to find a lebensmöglichkeit in a really multikulturellen world , which is the wisdom of all humans .
so , i would like to summarize my talk , in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the vogt , and we &apos;ve gone back to a little bit of a verschütt , and that we &apos;ve been able to use that kind of stuff , and that we can actually get back to our roots , and that we can actually get back to our roots .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet called hafiz in the 14th century , telling me my friend jacques dembois , and the poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words , &quot; and the poem is &quot; god , who knows only four words , &quot; but the god who knows only four words .
and if you have people who are the dominant conviction that they have a soul , or you can also say that they have been brought to life from the soul to life , then they think that &apos;s like the soul of a mental framework , not matter matter of matter , and , you know , a little bit of blood and blood , verwesbares , ja , ja .
what makes it so fascinating is not just the potential of the potential potential , but it &apos;s made . it &apos;s made out of two different sources . on one side , there &apos;s this wooden liane , which is a series of betakarbolinen , which is a series of betakarbolinen , harmin , harmolin , and it &apos;s just like a blue trüber , birgt . .
one of them is , in fact , the great choice of different salatdressings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is kind of perfect -- it &apos;s just like , you know , you could have a different choice , and what &apos;s going on is that you &apos;ve got a different decision , and what &apos;s going to happen is that you have a different choice to make it , and what &apos;s happening is that you have a different choice .
at the end of this amazing initiation , they &apos;re going to be one day , and for the first time in their lives , at age 18 , you see a sonnenaufgang . and in this kristallklaren moment of consciousness , when the sun begins to strahlen , and the moment moment of the first light , when the sun begins on the edge of the amazing beautiful landscape , the priest is going to be erstaunlich .
how can i talk about the connection in 10 minutes of the relationship between three generations , and how the amazing power of this connectedness is in a four of a four year-old girl , when she was about 30 years ago with her little sister and her grandmother , and her grandmother , and she &apos;s been standing in a small boat in the chinese ocean , and a bond of her grandmother was going to be a small boat in san francisco today .
from the medical point of view , you can say that my legs , the laser-chirurgie for sehbehinderungen , kniegelenke of titanium and artificial körper for aging &apos;s body , will allow people to build their natural destiny , to develop , not to talk about social intelligence systems , to create their own lives , to create their own identity .
just knowing that jaguar-schamanen is still traveling beyond the milky way or the meaning of the oldest of the inuit of the inuit of the inuit of the inuit , or that in the himalayas , the buddhisten is still tracking the breath of the dharma , which is the idea that the world is in the world .
it &apos;s been invented , but we have enough online-inhalte , so it will become realistic for you and actually live your real life without oil . so , if you &apos;re ready to go to the game , you know , you know , how much oil is , you know , and then you can figure out how much oil is , you know , how much oil is not going to be .
and wherever you &apos;re in the world , you &apos;re going to find that these cultures are not going to be geweiht . this is dynamic living peoples , which is verdrängt by their capacity to move beyond the ungeheuerliche of the anpassung , which is the ungeheuerliche of the anpassung .
